## 10.6 Introduction: From Hardware to Interactive Visual UI

A display is only as good as its firmware. Turning raw pixels into a responsive, beautiful user interface requires careful initialization, optimized graphics code, and robust UI frameworks.  
This part is a **detailed, beginner-friendly, and exhaustive guide** to display firmware, graphics libraries, UI frameworks, and best practices for embedded workstation visual UI.

---

## 10.7 Display Initialization and Low-Level Firmware

### 10.7.1 Power-Up Sequence and Reset

- Many displays need power and reset lines sequenced (e.g., keep RESET LOW for 10ms after power, then HIGH).
- Failing to follow datasheet timing can result in blank or garbled screens.
- Use MCU GPIO to control RESET; some displays need delays between commands.

### 10.7.2 Interface Initialization (SPI, I2C, Parallel)

- **SPI**: Set up SPI peripheral (clock speed, mode, bit order), select correct CS line.
- **I2C**: Set bus speed, use correct slave address (often 0x3C or 0x78 for OLEDs).
- **Parallel**: Set all data and control lines as outputs; ensure timing matches datasheet (e.g., setup/hold times).

#### 10.7.2.1 Example: SSD1306 OLED Init (I2C)

```c
i2c_write(SSD_ADDR, SSD_COMMAND_MODE, 0xAE); // Display off
i2c_write(SSD_ADDR, SSD_COMMAND_MODE, 0xD5); // Set display clock
i2c_write(SSD_ADDR, SSD_COMMAND_MODE, 0x80); // Clock divide
// ... more commands ...
i2c_write(SSD_ADDR, SSD_COMMAND_MODE, 0xAF); // Display on
```

### 10.7.3 Sending Commands/Data to Display Controllers

- Most displays have separate “command” and “data” modes (e.g., DC pin, or byte prefix).
- Always check datasheet for required sequences (e.g., set page/column address before writing data).
- Use burst writes for speed; avoid single-pixel updates on slow links.

### 10.7.4 Framebuffer Concepts: Full, Partial, and Tiled

- **Full framebuffer**: All display pixels represented in RAM (e.g., 128x64x1bpp = 1KB)
- **Partial framebuffer**: Only update dirty regions to save RAM (used on MCUs with little RAM)
- **Tiled**: Divide display into pages/tiles (e.g., 8x8 blocks), update only changed tiles

#### 10.7.4.1 Example: Double Buffering

- One buffer shown, one buffer being drawn to; swap for tear-free updates

### 10.7.5 DMA and Hardware Acceleration

- Many MCUs support DMA for SPI/I2C; offload data transfer to hardware
- Some display drivers (e.g., RA8875) accelerate lines, rectangles, fonts in hardware
- Use these features to keep UI snappy and reduce CPU load

### 10.7.6 Handling Display Errors and Self-Test

- Check for ACK/NACK on I2C/SPI
- Implement startup self-test: show test pattern, read display ID, verify response
- On error, blink indicator LED, show error code, or log via debug UART

## 10.8 Graphics Libraries for Embedded Displays

### 10.8.1 Why Use a Graphics Library?

- Abstracts low-level pixel drawing, provides primitives (lines, circles, text)
- Faster development, less bugs, easier re-use across hardware
- Many libraries optimized for speed/memory on MCUs

### 10.8.2 u8g2, Adafruit_GFX, LittlevGL (LVGL), and Others

#### 10.8.2.1 u8g2

- Monochrome, small color, supports many displays (OLED, LCD, VFD)
- Minimal RAM (can use page mode), built-in fonts and icons

#### 10.8.2.2 Adafruit_GFX

- Color, classic for Arduino/STM32
- Works with ILI9341, ST7735, SSD1306, and more
- Easy to extend, lightweight

#### 10.8.2.3 LVGL (LittlevGL)

- Modern, powerful, open source, supports touch, animation, widgets, themes
- Full UI framework: buttons, sliders, lists, tabs, images, charts
- Requires more RAM (framebuffer), best for MCUs with 64KB+ RAM or external RAM

#### 10.8.2.4 Others

- µGFX, emWin, TouchGFX, STemWin, GUIslice, Segger, custom C/C++ libraries

### 10.8.3 Drawing Primitives: Pixels, Lines, Rectangles, Circles

- All libraries provide basic functions:
    - Set pixel (x, y)
    - Draw line (Bresenham’s algorithm)
    - Draw rectangle (filled, outline)
    - Draw circle/ellipse (filled, outline)
    - Draw triangle/polygon

#### 10.8.3.1 Example: Drawing a Meter

```c
gfx_draw_rect(10, 10, 100, 8, COLOR_WHITE);
gfx_fill_rect(10, 10, value, 8, COLOR_GREEN);
```

### 10.8.4 Text Rendering: Fonts, Unicode, and Anti-Aliasing

- Bitmap fonts (fixed or variable width), stored in PROGMEM or RAM
- Unicode: Multilingual support, special symbols, emoji
- Anti-aliased fonts: Smooth edges, more RAM/CPU needed

#### 10.8.4.1 Font Selection

- Use built-in or custom fonts; tradeoff between size and readability
- For small OLEDs: 5x8, 6x12, 8x16 common

#### 10.8.4.2 Text Alignment

- Left, center, right, baseline, vertical/horizontal centering

### 10.8.5 Bitmaps, Sprites, and Icon Storage

- Store icons as bitmap arrays or use external flash for many images
- RLE (Run-Length Encoding), PNG/JPEG decode for complex graphics (needs more RAM/CPU)
- Sprite animation: blit frames from sprite sheet, mask transparency as needed

### 10.8.6 Double Buffering and Tear-Free Updates

- Redraw to off-screen buffer, then transfer to display in one go
- Avoids flicker/tearing, but uses more RAM
- For partial updates, track “dirty rectangles” to minimize redraw

### 10.8.7 Memory, Speed, and Library Optimization

- Optimize drawing routines for your MCU (inline, DMA, lookup tables)
- Use bounding rectangles to limit redraw area
- Store resources (fonts, images) in flash/ROM if possible

---

## 10.9 UI Frameworks: Menus, Widgets, and Graphics Layout

### 10.9.1 Menu Systems

- Simple menu: list of entries, up/down/select
- Hierarchical: nested submenus for deep settings
- Grid: for pad or matrix navigation (e.g., step sequencer)
- Tabs: for multi-page UIs, quick switching

#### 10.9.1.1 Menu Data Structures

```c
typedef struct MenuItem {
    const char* label;
    void (*callback)(void);
    struct MenuItem* submenu;
} MenuItem;
```

### 10.9.2 Widget Types

- **Button:** On/off, momentary, toggle
- **Knob:** Rotary value, continuous or detented
- **Slider:** Linear, horizontal or vertical, for levels and pans
- **Meter:** Level, peak, VU, spectrum
- **Graph/Chart:** Envelope, waveform, sequencer, LFO, modulation

#### 10.9.2.1 Widget State

- Each widget has a state (value, focus, active/inactive)
- Store in struct per widget, update/redraw as needed

### 10.9.3 UI Event Handling: Touch, Encoder, Button, MIDI

- Collect events from all input sources
- Central event queue: decouple UI update from hardware scan
- Event types: press, release, drag, rotate, value change, etc.

#### 10.9.3.1 Example Event Struct

```c
typedef enum { EVT_BTN, EVT_ENC, EVT_TOUCH, EVT_MIDI } EventType;
typedef struct {
    EventType type;
    uint16_t  code;
    int32_t   value;
    uint32_t  timestamp;
} UIEvent;
```

- Dispatch events to active widget, menu, or screen

### 10.9.4 Focus, Selection, and Navigation Models

- Only one widget or menu has “focus” at a time (highlighted, accepts input)
- Navigation via encoder, arrow keys, touch, or MIDI
- Visual cues: highlight, border, invert, color

### 10.9.5 Animation, Transitions, and Redraw Strategies

- Fade in/out, slide, bounce, pulse for UI changes
- Redraw only changed regions for speed (dirty rectangles)
- Schedule animations using timers or frame counters

### 10.9.6 Multi-Display and Multi-Layer UI

- Multi-display: main screen + per-track OLEDs or meters
- Layer UI: overlays, popups, dialogs (e.g., confirmation box on top of main UI)
- Synchronize redraws and event handling

### 10.9.7 Touch-Friendly vs. Encoder/Menu UI

- Touch: large hitboxes, feedback on tap, gestures
- Encoder/menu: focus highlight, wrap-around, fast/slow acceleration
- Support both modes where possible for flexibility

- **GT911:** High-res capacitive, up to 10 points, I2C
- **STMPE610:** Capacitive, SPI/I2C, used in Adafruit and other kits

### 10.10.2 Firmware: Calibration, Filtering, and Coordinate Mapping

#### 10.10.2.1 Calibration

- Map raw touch coordinates to screen coordinates
- Store calibration points in EEPROM/flash
- Offer on-screen calibration routine

#### 10.10.2.2 Filtering

- Median or moving average filter to reduce jitter
- Ignore or debounce short, spurious touches

#### 10.10.2.3 Mapping

- Convert raw (X,Y) to pixel coordinates, handle screen rotation and scaling

### 10.10.3 Touch Gestures: Tap, Long Press, Swipe, Drag, Pinch

- Detect press duration for tap/long press
- Track finger movement for swipe/drag
- Multi-point for pinch/zoom/rotate (if supported by hardware)
- Use gesture state machines for reliable detection

### 10.10.4 Multi-Touch and Pressure Sensitivity

- Multi-touch: track IDs per finger (if hardware supports)
- Pressure: some controllers/ICs report pressure level for expressive control

### 10.10.5 UI Design for Touch: Hitboxes, Feedback, Usability

- Make buttons/controls large enough for finger targeting (min ~7-10mm)
- Provide visual/audio/haptic feedback on press
- Avoid complex gestures unless clearly indicated

### 10.10.6 Handling Touch and Hardware Controls Together

- Allow seamless handoff between touch, encoder, and button input
- Sync focus state (e.g., tap on widget gives focus, encoder then tweaks value)
- Prioritize input sources as needed (e.g., ignore touch when in menu mode)

---

## 10.11 Display Firmware Best Practices

### 10.11.1 Performance: Update Rates, Partial Refresh, and Prioritization

- Prioritize critical UI elements (meters, tempo) for higher refresh
- Use partial refresh for large or slow displays (E-Ink, low-power TFT)
- Use timers/RTOS tasks to schedule redraws, avoid blocking main loop

### 10.11.2 Power Management: Dimming, Sleep, and Wake

- Dim or blank display after inactivity (auto sleep)
- Wake on button/touch/encoder or MIDI event
- Reduce backlight brightness or power down for battery savings

### 10.11.3 Error Handling, Logging, and Diagnostics

- Display error/status codes on-screen, or blink code with LEDs if display fails
- Log errors to UART, USB, or persistent storage for debugging
- Self-test routines for display and touch at boot

### 10.11.4 Modular Firmware Architecture for UI

- Separate hardware drivers (display, touch) from UI logic
- Use MVC (Model-View-Controller) or similar patterns for clean code
- Allow for UI upgrades or skinning (custom themes, layouts)

### 10.11.5 Upgrading, Expansion, and Versioning

- Support for multiple display types with abstraction layers
- Version display firmware and UI layouts for compatibility
- Allow future expansion: more widgets, higher-res displays, multi-display systems
