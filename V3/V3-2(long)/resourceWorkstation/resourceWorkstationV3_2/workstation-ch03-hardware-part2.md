## 3.11 Analog Audio Subsystem Overview

The analog audio subsystem is critical for delivering the warmth, headroom, and low-noise performance that distinguish a professional workstation from commodity digital devices. This subsystem typically includes a high-quality DAC, analog low-pass or multimode filter (VCF), voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA), routing and mixing stages, and interfaces for external analog control or expansion.

**Key goals:**
- Ultra-low noise and distortion
- Wide frequency response (at least 20Hz–20kHz, ideally better)
- High dynamic range (>100dB)
- Robust protection against overvoltage, ESD, and user error
- Modular, serviceable design for future upgrades

## 3.12 DAC and ADC Selection & Integration

### 3.12.1 DAC Selection Criteria

| Feature           | Why It Matters                        | Example Chips             |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Bit Depth         | Dynamic range, headroom               | 24/32-bit recommended     |
| Sample Rate       | Fidelity, anti-aliasing, FX           | 48, 96, 192kHz            |
| Interface         | Compatibility with SoC                | I2S (preferred), SPI      |
| THD+N             | Clean analog output                   | < -100dB                  |
| SNR               | Low noise floor                       | > 110dB                   |
| Power Rails       | Board integration, analog isolation   | 3.3V/5V, split analog/dig |

**Popular Choices:**
- **PCM5102A (TI):** 24-bit, 192kHz, I2S, low power, easy to source, good docs.
- **ESS ES9023/ES9038:** Audiophile-grade, ultra-low noise, more complex integration.
- **AKM AK4490:** High-end, multiple filter options, generally for flagship builds.

### 3.12.2 ADC Selection Criteria

- **Bit Depth:** Minimum 24-bit for audio input, 12–16bit for CV.
- **Sample Rate:** 48kHz+ for audio, 1–10kHz for CV/trigger.
- **Channels:** Stereo or quad for audio, multi (4–16) for CV.
- **Interface:** I2S/SPI for audio, SPI or parallel for CV (e.g., MCP3208).

### 3.12.3 Integration Best Practices

- **Clocking:** Use a low-jitter oscillator for I2S master clock, preferably not shared with SoC.
- **Decoupling:** Place decoupling capacitors close to DAC/ADC power pins.
- **Layout:** Place DAC/ADC as close to analog filter/amp as possible, away from SoC and digital lines.
- **Grounding:** Use isolated analog ground plane, single point join to digital ground.

**Tip:**  
Always use a dedicated analog 3.3V/5V regulator for DAC/ADC chips—never share with noisy digital supply.

|------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| State Variable   | LP/HP/BP simultaneously, easy mod  | Versatile, stable            | More op-amps, comp.     |
| Ladder (Moog)    | Classic sound, soft clipping       | Iconic tone                  | Harder to tune, temp.   |
| Sallen-Key       | Simple, 2-pole lowpass             | Minimal parts, easy build    | Less flexible           |
| OTA (e.g. LM13700)| Voltage-controlled, compact       | Easily modulated             | Needs careful design    |
