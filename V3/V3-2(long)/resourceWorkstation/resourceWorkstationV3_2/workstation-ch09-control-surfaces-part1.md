## 9.1 Introduction: Why Control Surfaces Matter in Workstations

A digital workstation is only as good as its interface.  
Physical controls—buttons, encoders, sliders, touch panels—let the musician interact intuitively with the system, playing, sequencing, and tweaking sounds in real time.

**Good control surfaces are:**
- Ergonomic: Comfortable and intuitive to use for hours
- Reliable: Withstand thousands of presses, twists, and sweeps
- Responsive: Fast, low-latency, and debounced
- Flexible: Support custom mapping, layering, and user feedback (LEDs, displays)

## 9.2 Physical Controls: Buttons, Switches, Encoders, Faders, and Knobs

### 9.2.1 Buttons and Switches: Types and Selection

#### 9.2.1.1 Momentary vs. Latching

- **Momentary:** Only active while pressed (e.g., keyboard, pad, trigger)
- **Latching:** Stays on/off until pressed again (toggle, power, mode select)

#### 9.2.1.2 Types of Buttons

| Type            | Typical Use                   | Notes                     |
|-----------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Tactile switch  | Pads, sequencer, transport   | “Click” feel, small size  |
| Dome switch     | Keyboards, drum pads         | Softer feel, larger travel|
| Mechanical key  | Step sequencers, performance | Long life, tactile/audible|
| Capacitive      | Touch buttons, modern UIs    | No moving parts, fragile  |
| Piezo           | Velocity/pressure sensing    | For dynamic pads          |
| Reed switch     | Magnetic, non-contact        | Used for pedal, rare      |

#### 9.2.1.3 Key Specs

- **Travel:** How far the button moves (mm)
- **Force:** Actuation force (grams or Newtons)
- **Life:** Rated cycles (e.g., 1 million presses)
- **Contact bounce:** How much the signal “chatters” as contacts close (ms)
- **Mounting:** Through-hole, SMD, or panel-mount

### 9.2.2 Tactile Switches, Keypads, and Mechanical Keys

#### 9.2.2.1 Tactile Switches

- Small, square or rectangular, 4 pins, “clicky” feel
- Common sizes: 6x6mm, 12x12mm
- SMD and through-hole variants
- Used for grid pads, menu navigation, triggers

#### 9.2.2.2 Keypads

- Multiple keys in a fixed matrix, often 3x4 or 4x4
- Used for number entry, step sequencers, menu pads

#### 9.2.2.3 Mechanical Key Switches

- Used in computer keyboards and high-end sequencers
- Types: Cherry MX, Kailh, Gateron, Alps
- Varieties: Linear, tactile, clicky (with different force/travel)
- Mounting: Plate or PCB, usually with LED support

#### 9.2.2.4 Rubber Dome and Membrane Switches

- Sheet of rubber domes, used in budget keypads
- Flexible PCB or membrane layers for traces
- Lower cost, less tactile, not as durable

### 9.2.3 Encoders: Relative, Absolute, and Optical

#### 9.2.3.1 Rotary Encoders

- **Relative:** Increment/decrement, no fixed position; great for endless knobs and data entry
- **Absolute:** Potentiometer with fixed start/end (volume, pan); value is position
- **Optical:** Use light, no contact, high precision, expensive

#### 9.2.3.2 Typical Rotary Encoder Specs

- **Detents:** Clicks per revolution (e.g., 20, 24, 32)
- **Pulses:** Electrical transitions per rev (can be 2x detents)
- **Push switch:** Some include a built-in push button
- **Shaft type:** D-shaft, round, knurled
- **Mounting:** PCB, panel

#### 9.2.3.3 Reading an Encoder

- Two outputs (A and B, “quadrature”)
- Read both for direction and speed
- Debounce required (mechanical bounce on transitions)

### 9.2.4 Potentiometers, Sliders, and Faders

#### 9.2.4.1 Potentiometers

- Variable resistor, acts as voltage divider
- Used for volume, pan, filter cutoff, etc.
- Types: Linear (audio taper), logarithmic (volume taper)

#### 9.2.4.2 Sliders/Faders

- Linear potentiometers; used for mixing consoles, synth faders
- Length: 30mm, 60mm, 100mm common
- Motorized faders: Motor moves the slider (automation, DAWs)

#### 9.2.4.3 Mounting and Knobs

- Shaft and panel style
- Knob selection: Size, material, pointer, skirt, D-shaft/spline

### 9.2.5 Rotary and Linear Sensors (Touch and Hall Effect)

#### 9.2.5.1 Touch Sensors

- Capacitive: Detect finger presence, used for touchstrips, pads, sliders
- Resistive: Pressure-sensitive, can be used for aftertouch or XY pads

#### 9.2.5.2 Hall Effect Sensors

- Non-contact, detect position of a magnet
- Used for endless encoders, faders, and joysticks in some high-end gear

## 9.3 Button/Key Matrix Circuits: Scanning Multiple Inputs Efficiently

### 9.3.1 Why Use a Matrix?

- Direct wiring: 16 buttons = 16 pins. Not scalable.
- Matrix: 4 rows x 4 columns = 16 buttons, only 8 pins needed!
- Larger grids (e.g., 8x8 = 64 buttons, only 16 pins)

### 9.3.2 Matrix Topology: Rows, Columns, and Diodes

#### 9.3.2.1 Basic Matrix

- Each button connects a row line to a column line
- MCU sets one row LOW at a time, reads columns
- Pressed button connects row and column

#### 9.3.2.2 Diode Protection

- Without diodes: “Ghosting” can occur (phantom key presses)
- Diode per switch allows any combo of keys to be detected

```plaintext
(Row) ----|>|----+---- (Col)
           Diode  |
                Button
```

### 9.3.3 Matrix Scanning Algorithms and Firmware

#### 9.3.3.1 Scanning Steps

1. Set all rows HIGH except one (set LOW)
2. Read all columns: LOW means button pressed
3. Move to next row, repeat

#### 9.3.3.2 Sample Pseudocode

```c
for (int row = 0; row < ROWS; ++row) {
    set_all_rows_high();
    set_row_low(row);
    for (int col = 0; col < COLS; ++col) {
        if (read_col(col) == LOW) {
            key_state[row][col] = 1;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 9.3.3.3 Scan Rate

- 1ms–10ms per full scan is typical for fast response

#### 9.3.3.4 Interrupt vs. Polling

- Polling: Simple, reliable, uses some CPU time
- Interrupt: Fast, but more complex, less common for large matrices

### 9.3.4 Debouncing: Hardware and Software Techniques

#### 9.3.4.1 What is Debouncing?

- Mechanical switches “bounce” (rapidly open/close) for 1–20ms when pressed or released
- Can cause multiple false triggers if not handled

#### 9.3.4.2 Hardware Debounce

- RC lowpass filter (resistor and capacitor)
- Schmitt trigger buffer (e.g., 74HC14)

#### 9.3.4.3 Software Debounce

- Ignore state changes that last <5–20ms
- Sample each key, require N consecutive samples to confirm change

#### 9.3.4.4 Example: Simple Software Debounce

- Store previous N readings (e.g., last 5 scans)
- Only register key press/release if all readings agree

### 9.3.5 Ghosting and Masking: Causes and Cures

#### 9.3.5.1 Ghosting

- Multiple keys pressed in a matrix can create “phantom” key signals (false triggers)
- Example: Pressing 3 corners of a square in the matrix can make the 4th appear pressed

#### 9.3.5.2 Masking

- Some keys become undetectable when others are held, especially in matrices without diodes

#### 9.3.5.3 Solution

- Use diodes in series with each button
- Software can also ignore impossible combos, but not foolproof

### 9.3.6 Expanding Beyond MCU Pin Limits: Multiplexers and I/O Expanders

#### 9.3.6.1 Multiplexers (Mux)

- ICs like 74HC4051/52/53: 8:1, 4:1, etc.
- Select 1 of N signals with digital address lines
- Can be used for rows or columns

#### 9.3.6.2 I/O Expanders

- I2C: PCF8574 (8 I/O), MCP23017 (16 I/O), etc.
- SPI: MCP23S17 (16 I/O)
- Daisy-chainable to add hundreds of inputs

#### 9.3.6.3 Shift Registers

- 74HC165 (parallel-in, serial-out), 74HC595 (serial-in, parallel-out)
- Used widely in MIDI controllers, keyboards, and LED grids

#### 9.3.6.4 Tradeoffs

- Multiplexers are faster but need more address lines
- I/O expanders are slower (I2C/SPI) but need only 2–3 MCU pins

## 9.4 Case Study: Designing a 4x4 Pad Matrix for a DIY Workstation

### 9.4.1 Hardware Schematic

- 4 rows, 4 columns = 16 pads
- Each pad has series diode (1N4148 common)
- Rows to MCU outputs, columns to inputs with pull-up resistors

### 9.4.2 PCB Layout Tips

- Keep row and column traces short and away from high-speed digital lines
- Use 0.2–0.5mm traces for signal, beefier for power
- Place pads in straight grid for even finger spacing
- Decouple MCU near power pins, add bulk cap for stability

### 9.4.3 Firmware Overview

- Scan matrix at 1ms intervals
- Software debounce: require 5 consistent reads
- Store key states in 2D array
- Generate MIDI Note On/Off or trigger sequencer events

### 9.4.4 LED Feedback

- Add RGB or monochrome LEDs per pad
- Use shift registers or LED drivers (TLC5940, WS2812) to control many LEDs
- Map pad state to LED color/brightness

### 9.4.5 Velocity and Aftertouch

- For velocity, use piezo or FSR sensor under pad (analog input)
- For aftertouch, sense continuous pressure during hold

### 9.4.6 Enclosure and Panel Design

- Cutouts for 16 pads in grid
- Use silicone pads or custom acrylic; backlight for visibility
- Secure PCB to panel with standoffs or self-clinching hardware
