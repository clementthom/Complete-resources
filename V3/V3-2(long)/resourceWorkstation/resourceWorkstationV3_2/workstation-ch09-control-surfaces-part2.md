## 9.6 Introduction: Modern Control Surface Feedback and Sensing

Modern music workstations and controllers offer much more than just buttons or knobs.  
To provide rich, interactive experiences, hardware must support:
- Visual feedback (LEDs, displays, animated cues)
- Touch and gesture input (pads, sliders, touchstrips)
- Expressive sensors (velocity, aftertouch, pressure, proximity)
- Haptic feedback (vibration, tactile “clicks”)
- Reliable, maintainable integration with the rest of the system

This part is a **detailed, beginner-friendly, and exhaustive guide** to implementing modern, expressive control surfaces.

## 9.7 LED Feedback: Types, Drivers, Matrixing, and Animation

### 9.7.1 Why LEDs Matter

- Give users immediate, intuitive feedback (step position, pad velocity, mute/solo state)
- Guide performance (metronome flash, status, paging)
- Enable advanced workflows (color for tracks/layers, animations for tempo, etc.)

### 9.7.2 LED Types

#### 9.7.2.1 Single Color LEDs

- Red, green, yellow, blue, white
- Through-hole (3mm, 5mm), SMD (0603, 0805, 1206)
- Use for simple indicators, status, or grid feedback

#### 9.7.2.2 RGB LEDs

- Common anode/cathode (3 or 4 pins)
- Control color by varying intensity of R/G/B
- SMD and through-hole types

#### 9.7.2.3 Addressable LEDs

- WS2812 ("NeoPixel"), APA102 ("DotStar"), SK6812, etc.
- Daisy-chained serial protocol; each LED individually controlled
- One-wire (WS2812) or SPI (APA102) for easy expansion
- Used in Launchpad, Push, Novation Circuit, etc.

#### 9.7.2.4 Bargraphs and Segmented

- Multiple LEDs in line or segment
- For level meters, progress bars, sliders, etc.

#### 9.7.2.5 OLED/Segment Displays

- For text, numbers, icons, or simple graphics (I2C/SPI interface)

### 9.7.3 LED Driving: Direct, Multiplexed, and Charlieplexed

#### 9.7.3.1 Direct Drive

- Each LED has its own MCU pin and resistor
- Simple, but not scalable for large grids

#### 9.7.3.2 Multiplexed Drive

- Rows and columns; light one row at a time, quickly scan
- 8x8 = 16 pins (8 rows + 8 cols) controls 64 LEDs
- Only one row/column on at a time, so LEDs may look dim (persistence of vision helps)
- Current-limiting resistors per row/col or per LED

#### 9.7.3.3 Charlieplexing

- Uses tri-state I/O; N pins can control N*(N-1) LEDs
- More complex, but maximizes pin usage for small/medium matrices

#### 9.7.3.4 Using LED Driver ICs

- Dedicated chips (TLC5940, MAX7219, HT16K33, IS31FL3731)
- Offload PWM, current control, and scanning from MCU
- Often I2C or SPI controlled, can daisy-chain for big boards

### 9.7.4 LED Matrix Circuits and Scanning

#### 9.7.4.1 Basic Matrix Schematic

- Rows driven by MCU or driver, columns as sinks (or vice versa)
- Diodes generally not needed unless shared with button matrix

#### 9.7.4.2 Scanning Algorithm

- For each row:
    - Set row active (HIGH or LOW)
    - Write column data (turn on only desired LEDs)
    - Delay (microseconds), then move to next row
- Repeat at >100Hz for flicker-free display

#### 9.7.4.3 PWM for Brightness

- For each row/col, pulse LEDs on/off rapidly to simulate different brightness levels
- 8-bit PWM = 256 brightness levels; 4-bit (16) is often enough for pads

### 9.7.5 High-Density LED Boards and Integrated Controllers

#### 9.7.5.1 Addressable LED Strips/Boards

- Daisy-chainable, add as many as memory/timing allows
- Single data line (WS2812) or data+clock (APA102)
- Strict timing requirements for certain protocols (WS2812)

#### 9.7.5.2 Integrated LED Controllers

- I2C/SPI chips that drive entire matrices or LED strips
- Examples: IS31FL3731 (144 LEDs), HT16K33 (128 LEDs)
- Often have built-in PWM, blink, and fade control

### 9.7.6 PWM Dimming, Color Mixing, and Animation Techniques

#### 9.7.6.1 PWM Dimming

- Rapidly turn LED on/off at high frequency (1kHz+) to adjust brightness
- Software PWM (firmware) or hardware PWM (timer/counter, driver IC)

#### 9.7.6.2 Color Mixing

- Vary R/G/B ratios for millions of colors
- Gamma correction: LEDs don’t appear linear, so apply a lookup curve

#### 9.7.6.3 Animation

- Step sequencer: chase lights, “waterfall” effects
- Velocity/feedback: flash, fade, pulse, color change
- Firmware: update LED buffer, run animation state machine per frame

#### 9.7.6.4 Examples

- Metronome: flash pad or ring of LEDs on beat
- Track arm: red = armed, green = safe, blue = muted

### 9.7.7 Firmware for LED Feedback

#### 9.7.7.1 State Machines

- Each LED/pad has a state: off, on, blink, fade, pulse, etc.
- State updated every frame by animation logic

#### 9.7.7.2 Buffering and DMA

- For large matrices, keep an array (“frame buffer”) of desired LED states
- DMA (Direct Memory Access) for fast updates to drivers (e.g., SPI to WS2812/APA102)

#### 9.7.7.3 Efficiency

- Avoid blocking code; use timers or interrupts for smooth animation
- Double-buffering: prepare next frame while previous is displayed

## 9.8 Capacitive and Resistive Touch Sensing

### 9.8.1 Capacitive Touch Sensors: Principles and ICs

#### 9.8.1.1 Principle
