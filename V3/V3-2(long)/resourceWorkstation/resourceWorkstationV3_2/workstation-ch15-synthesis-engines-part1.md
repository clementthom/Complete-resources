## 15.1 Introduction: What is Synthesis?

Sound synthesis is the process of generating audio signals electronically, rather than recording them from real-world sources.  
Workstations and synthesizers use various synthesis methods to create everything from classic analog tones to complex, evolving textures.

**Why is synthesis important in a workstation?**
- Enables creation of infinite sounds, from emulations of real instruments to abstract digital tones
- Offers deep control for musicians, sound designers, and engineers
- Fundamental to electronic music, film, games, and interactive media

Modern workstations integrate multiple synthesis engines, allowing users to mix, layer, and sequence sounds in powerful ways.

## 15.2 Synthesis Engine Fundamentals

### 15.2.1 What is Sound Synthesis? Historical Overview

- **Early Days:** 1930s-60s — Electronic organs, vacuum tube oscillators, the RCA Mark II
- **Analog Era:** 1960s-80s — Moog, ARP, Roland, Yamaha built voltage-controlled synths (VCO, VCF, VCA)
- **Digital Revolution:** 1980s-90s — Yamaha DX7 (FM synthesis), Casio CZ (phase distortion), Korg M1 (PCM/rompler)
- **Modern Era:** Hybrid digital/analog, software synths, modular, embedded DSP, physical modeling

### 15.2.2 Types of Synthesis

- **Subtractive:** Start with rich harmonics (oscillator), sculpt with filter and envelope (classic analog, e.g., Minimoog, Jupiter-8)
- **Additive:** Build sound by adding sine waves (partials), each with its own amplitude/frequency (Hammond organ, Kawai K5000)
- **FM (Frequency Modulation):** Use one oscillator to modulate frequency of another, creating complex spectra (Yamaha DX7, modern FM synths)
- **Wavetable:** Read through a table of single-cycle waveforms, interpolate for smooth morphing (PPG Wave, Waldorf, Serum)
- **Granular:** Split sound into grains, manipulate position, pitch, density (Pad/texture synths, GR-1, Ableton Granulator)
- **Physical Modeling:** Simulate real-world instruments using math/physics (Yamaha VL1, Pianoteq, Mutable Instruments Elements)
- **Vector/Hybrid:** Blend multiple synthesis methods, interpolate between sources (Korg Wavestation, Roland JD series)

### 15.2.3 Digital vs. Analog Synthesis Engines

- **Analog:** Voltage-controlled, continuous, subject to drift/noise, “warm” and “alive” sound, limited by hardware
- **Digital:** Discrete, precise, stable, can be complex, “clean” or “cold,” can emulate analog features with DSP

### 15.2.4 Voice Architecture: Mono, Poly, Multi-Timbral

- **Monophonic:** One note at a time (classic bass/lead synths)
- **Polyphonic:** Multiple notes/voices (chords, pads)
- **Multi-Timbral:** Multiple sounds/instruments at once, each on its own MIDI channel/zone (e.g., workstation with drum kit, bass, pad, lead)

### 15.2.5 Oscillator, Voice, and Signal Flow Concepts

- **Oscillator (VCO/DCO/Digital):** Generates raw waveform (sine, saw, square, etc.)
- **Voice:** All components needed to play one note (osc, filter, amp, envelopes)
- **Signal Flow:** Oscillator → Filter → Amplifier → Output, with modulation sources routed throughout

## 15.3 Oscillators: The Heart of Synthesis

### 15.3.1 What is an Oscillator? Sine, Saw, Square, Triangle, Noise

- **Oscillator:** Circuit or algorithm that produces periodic waveforms
- **Common Shapes:**
  - **Sine:** Pure tone, one frequency (no harmonics)
  - **Sawtooth:** Bright, all harmonics, classic for strings, brass
  - **Square/Pulse:** Hollow, odd harmonics, width mod for PWM
  - **Triangle:** Softer, fewer harmonics, good for flutes/soft leads
  - **Noise:** Random, used for percussion, special effects

#### 15.3.1.1 Visual Examples

```
Sine:      ~~~~~
Saw:      /|/|/|
Square:   _|‾|_|
Triangle: /\/\
Noise:    .''..'..'.
```

### 15.3.2 Digital Oscillator Implementation (Tables, Algorithms, Code)

#### 15.3.2.1 Lookup Table (Wavetable):

- Store one cycle of waveform in an array; read through table at frequency = note pitch
- Use interpolation (linear, Hermite, cubic) for smooth pitch

```c
#define TABLE_SIZE 1024
float sine_table[TABLE_SIZE];
int phase = 0;
float phase_inc = freq * TABLE_SIZE / sample_rate;

float get_sample() {
    float sample = sine_table[(int)phase];
    phase += phase_inc;
    if (phase >= TABLE_SIZE) phase -= TABLE_SIZE;
    return sample;
}
```

#### 15.3.2.2 BLEP/PolyBLEP for Anti-Aliasing

- Band-Limited Step algorithms smooth waveform edges to reduce digital aliasing, especially on saw/square

#### 15.3.2.3 Direct Calculation

- Calculate each sample on the fly (e.g., sin(), sign(), saw = phase/TABLE_SIZE)
- More CPU-intensive, no pre-computed harmonics

### 15.3.3 Analog Oscillator Characteristics and Emulation

- **Analog Drift:** Small random pitch fluctuations, “alive” sound
- **Imperfect Shapes:** Real analog waves not perfectly linear/symmetric
- **Emulation:** Add LFO drift, random phase, shape imperfections in code

### 15.3.4 Anti-Aliasing in Digital Oscillators

- **Why Aliasing Happens:** Digital systems can’t represent frequencies above half the sample rate (Nyquist)
- **Solutions:**
  - BLEP/PolyBLEP: Smoothing discontinuities in waveforms
  - Oversampling: Process at higher sample rate, then downsample
  - Lowpass Filtering: Remove high harmonics before output

### 15.3.5 Oscillator Modulation: PWM, Sync, FM, AM

- **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation):** Change duty cycle of square wave for timbral variety
- **Sync:** Reset slave oscillator phase to master, creates rich harmonics
- **FM (Frequency Modulation):** Use one oscillator to modulate frequency of another (see FM synthesis in next part)
- **AM (Amplitude Modulation):** Multiply oscillator outputs for tremolo or ring mod effects

## 15.4 Subtractive Synthesis: Filters, Envelopes, and Modulation

### 15.4.1 The Subtractive Paradigm: Overview and Signal Flow

- Start with harmonically rich source (oscillator or noise)
- Pass through filter to sculpt spectrum (remove frequencies)
- Shape volume with amplitude envelope (ADSR)
- Modulate filter, amp, pitch, etc. with LFOs, envelopes, velocity, aftertouch

#### 15.4.1.1 Classic Subtractive Signal Flow

```
[Oscillator] → [Filter] → [Amplifier] → [Output]
        |          |           |
      LFO/ENV    LFO/ENV    LFO/ENV
```

### 15.4.2 Filter Types: LPF, HPF, BPF, Notch, Comb

- **LPF (Low-Pass Filter):** Removes frequencies above cutoff
- **HPF (High-Pass):** Removes below cutoff
- **BPF (Band-Pass):** Passes only a band around center frequency
- **Notch (Band-Stop):** Removes a band of frequencies
- **Comb:** Series of notches/peaks; used for phasing, chorus, resonator FX

### 15.4.3 Filter Circuits and Digital Implementations

- **Analog Circuits:** Moog ladder, OTA, SSM, state-variable
- **Digital Algorithms:** Biquad, state-variable, zero-delay feedback, SVF

```c
// Simple digital biquad filter structure
typedef struct {
    float a0, a1, a2, b1, b2;
    float x1, x2, y1, y2;
} biquad_t;

float biquad_process(biquad_t* f, float x) {
    float y = f->a0*x + f->a1*f->x1 + f->a2*f->x2 - f->b1*f->y1 - f->b2*f->y2;
    f->x2 = f->x1; f->x1 = x;
    f->y2 = f->y1; f->y1 = y;
    return y;
}
```

### 15.4.4 Envelopes: ADSR, AHDSR, Multi-Segment

- **ADSR:** Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release — shapes how sound evolves over time
- **AHDSR:** Adds Hold segment (useful for percussive/plucked sounds)
- **Multi-Segment:** Arbitrary number of segments, custom curves, breakpoints

#### 15.4.4.1 Envelope Application

- Controls amplitude, filter cutoff, pitch, FX, almost any parameter

### 15.4.5 LFOs, Modulation Matrix, and Routing

- **LFO (Low-Frequency Oscillator):** Slow periodic modulation (vibrato, tremolo, filter sweeps)
- **Modulation Matrix:** Flexible routing — assign any source (LFO, envelope, aftertouch, mod wheel, CV) to any destination (pitch, filter, amp, FX)
- **Depth/Amount:** Controls how strongly modulation affects target

### 15.4.6 Analog vs. Digital Filter Sound

- **Analog:** Nonlinearities, saturation, self-oscillation, drift — “character”
- **Digital:** Precise, flexible, can emulate analog quirks or go beyond
