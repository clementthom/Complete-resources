## 14.1 Introduction: The Power of Sampling in Modern Workstations

Sampling is at the heart of modern music production, from classic drum machines and phrase samplers to advanced granular engines and real-time live loopers.  
A robust sampling engine enables:
- Capturing and manipulating real-world sound
- Importing user content, libraries, and field recordings
- Building expressive playable instruments from any audio
- Creating loops, slices, and layers for beats, melodies, and textures

This chapter is a **detailed, beginner-friendly, and exhaustive guide** to sampling engines—covering hardware, firmware, data structures, and user interface.

## 14.2 Sampling Engine Fundamentals

### 14.2.1 What is Sampling? History and Modern Use

- **Sampling:** Digitizing analog audio and playing it back under control (trigger, note, pattern)
- **History:** Fairlight CMI, E-mu Emulator, Akai S-series, MPC, SP-1200, Ensoniq Mirage
- **Modern Use:** Samplers are everywhere—from DAWs and grooveboxes to synths and effects pedals

**Key concepts:**
- **One-shot:** Play sample once when triggered (drum hits, FX)
- **Looped:** Seamless playback for sustained notes (pads, multisamples)
- **Granular:** Chopped or time-stretched playback (ambient, glitch, experimental)
- **Multisample:** Multiple samples mapped to keys/velocity for realism

### 14.2.2 Sampler Types: Drum, Phrase, Granular, Multisample, Loopers

- **Drum Sampler:** Trigger short, percussive samples on pads/steps (e.g., Roland SP-404, MPC)
- **Phrase Sampler:** Play longer samples or phrases, often with pitch/tempo sync (e.g., Octatrack, Digitakt)
- **Granular Sampler:** Split sample into grains for time-stretch, pitch-shift, texture (e.g., Ableton Simpler, GR-1)
- **Multisample Sampler:** Map samples to keys/velocities for natural instruments (e.g., Kontakt, hardware workstations)
- **Live Looper:** Record and overdub in real time, sync with tempo (e.g., Boss RC-series, Looperlative, Ableton Looper)

### 14.2.3 Audio Path: Analog In, Preamp, ADC, Digital Routing

- **Input:** Analog sources (mic, line, instrument, phono), possibly with phantom power
- **Preamp:** Boosts signal to ADC-friendly level, may offer gain control, pad, high-pass filter
- **ADC:** Converts analog to digital (PCM); 16, 24, or 32 bits; 44.1, 48, 96kHz+
- **Digital Routing:** Mix, split, monitor, apply FX, and send to record buffer

### 14.2.4 Sample Storage: RAM, Flash, SD, Streaming

- **RAM:** Fast, limited by cost/board space (4–512MB typical, up to GB in pro gear)
- **Flash/NAND:** Nonvolatile, for persistent libraries, user banks (may be slower to access)
- **SD/microSD:** Removable storage for import/export, streaming large samples
- **Streaming:** Read sample data from storage in real time (vs. loading whole sample to RAM)
- **Paging:** Load/unload portions of long samples as needed

## 14.3 Audio Capture: Hardware, Firmware, and Signal Flow

### 14.3.1 Audio Inputs: Line, Mic, Instrument, Phono

- **Line Level:** +4dBu (pro), -10dBV (consumer); for synths, mixers, audio interfaces
- **Mic Level:** Very low; needs significant gain (40–60dB); balanced XLR inputs, phantom power for condenser mics
- **Instrument (Hi-Z):** Guitar/bass; needs high input impedance (500k–2MΩ) and proper gain
- **Phono:** Turntable; needs RIAA equalization and additional gain

### 14.3.2 Preamp, Gain Staging, and Impedance Matching

- **Preamp:** Amplifies input to ADC level; may be analog (op-amp, transformer) or digital
- **Gain Staging:** Adjust input gain to maximize SNR, avoid clipping (use meters, peak LEDs)
- **Impedance Matching:** Prevents signal loss/distortion; use appropriate input circuitry for mic/line/instrument

### 14.3.3 ADCs: Resolution, Sample Rate, Anti-Aliasing

- **Resolution:** 16-bit (CD quality), 24-bit (pro), 32-bit float (DAWs)
- **Sample Rate:** 44.1kHz (CD), 48kHz (video, modern), 96/192kHz (high-res, design/FX)
- **Anti-Aliasing Filter:** Analog lowpass before ADC to prevent aliasing
- **Sigma-Delta ADCs:** Widely used for audio; high SNR, low distortion

### 14.3.4 Digital Audio Routing: Buses, Mixing, Monitoring

- **Internal Buses:** Route audio to record buffer, FX, or direct monitor
- **Digital Mixers:** Combine multiple sources before recording
- **Monitor Paths:** Allow user to hear input while sampling (direct or through FX/DAW)
- **Routing Matrix:** Flexible mapping of inputs to buses, outputs, and recorders

### 14.3.5 Input Monitoring, Latency, and Direct/Software Paths

- **Input Monitoring:** Listen to input while recording; may be direct (low-latency) or post-FX/DSP (may add latency)
- **Latency:** Total time from input to headphones; must be minimized for live performance/overdubbing
- **Zero-Latency Monitoring:** Hardware path bypasses DSP/CPU; useful for vocals, live sampling

### 14.3.6 Recording Triggers, Thresholds, and Pre-Record Buffers

- **Manual Trigger:** User presses “Rec” to start
- **Auto Trigger:** Starts when input exceeds threshold (handy for one-shot, drums, field recording)
- **Pre-Record Buffer:** Records audio before trigger, so no attack is missed (e.g., 0.5–2s buffer)
- **Firmware:** Handles trigger logic, buffer management, and “punch-in” for seamless capture

## 14.4 Sample Data Structures and Management

### 14.4.1 Raw PCM, WAV, AIFF, FLAC, and Proprietary Formats

- **PCM (Pulse Code Modulation):** Raw audio samples, uncompressed
- **WAV:** Microsoft/RIFF format, supports PCM, ADPCM, floating-point, metadata
- **AIFF:** Apple format, similar to WAV, big-endian, metadata
- **FLAC:** Lossless compressed, good for sample libraries, needs more CPU for decode
- **Proprietary:** Some samplers use custom formats (to store extra metadata, zones, etc.)

#### 14.4.1.1 Format Considerations

- **Endianness:** Little/big endian matters for PCM, AIFF, some hardware
- **Header Parsing:** WAV/AIFF have headers with sample rate, bit depth, loop points, etc.
- **Chunked Data:** WAV/AIFF can embed loop points, markers, text, etc.

### 14.4.2 Sample Metadata: Loop Points, Root Note, Zones, Tags

- **Loop Points:** Start/end (and crossfade) for seamless sustain
- **Root Note:** MIDI note number for pitch mapping
- **Zones:** Key/velocity ranges, round robin, articulations
- **Tags:** User or factory labels for search, filtering, banks

#### 14.4.2.1 Metadata Example (WAV ‘smpl’ chunk)

- Loop start: 10000, Loop end: 40000 (samples)
- Root note: 60 (C4)
- Pitch correction: ±cents

### 14.4.3 Multisample Mapping: Key, Velocity, Round Robin, Articulation

- **Key Mapping:** Assign samples to specific keys/ranges (e.g., C1–B1 = Kick, C2–B2 = Snare)
- **Velocity Layers:** Different samples for soft/hard playing (e.g., piano ff, mf, pp)
- **Round Robin:** Cycle through samples on repeated notes for realism
- **Articulation:** Different samples for staccato, legato, muted, slides

#### 14.4.3.1 Data Structure Example (C)

```c
typedef struct {
    int start, end;
    int loop_start, loop_end;
    int root_note;
    int velocity_lo, velocity_hi;
    int zone_id, articulation_id;
    char* filename;
} SampleZone;
```

### 14.4.4 Streaming vs. RAM Playback

- **RAM Playback:** Load sample fully into RAM for instant, glitch-free response
- **Streaming:** Read from storage in real time (for long samples, limited RAM)
- **Prefetch Buffer:** Read ahead to prevent dropouts if storage is slow
- **Hybrid:** Stream long samples, RAM for short “hits” (optimized for polyphony)

### 14.4.5 Sample Pool, Bank, and File Management

- **Sample Pool:** All loaded samples in memory for instant access
- **Bank:** User-defined groups (kits, instruments, sets)
- **File Management:** Import/export, delete, rename, tag, search
- **Sample Reference Counting:** Track use to allow safe delete/unload

### 14.4.6 Sample Import, Export, and Compatibility

- **Import:** WAV, AIFF, FLAC, SFZ, proprietary; handle different rates, bit depths, mono/stereo
- **Export:** Save user samples/loops in standard or native format
- **Compatibility:** Naming conventions, folder structure, metadata for DAWs and 3rd-party gear

## 14.5 Sampler UI: Display, Feedback, and Hardware Controls

### 14.5.1 Waveform Display: Zoom, Scroll, Markers

- **Waveform View:** Show full/zoomed sample, playback/rec head, loop markers
- **Zoom:** Pinch/encoder/buttons to zoom in/out for fine editing
- **Scroll:** Move view to see any region of sample
- **Markers:** Set start, end, loop points, slices, cue points visually

### 14.5.2 Pad/Key Mapping: Grids, Zones, and Banks

- **Pad Grid:** Map samples to pads (4x4, 8x8, etc.); visual feedback when triggered
- **Keyboard/Keyzone:** Map samples to keys (MIDI note, USB, hardware keyboard)
- **Zones:** Visual overlays for velocity, articulation, round robin
- **Bank Switching:** Quick swap between sets for performance

### 14.5.3 Sample Browsing, Search, and Tagging

- **Browser UI:** List, grid, or waveform preview of samples
- **Search:** By name, tag, length, pitch, type
- **Tagging:** User assigns tags for genre, instrument, mood, etc.
- **Audition:** Preview samples without loading to pool

### 14.5.4 Real-Time Level Meters and Peak Hold

- **Input/Output Meters:** Show level during sampling and playback
- **Peak Hold:** Retain max level for visibility
- **Clip Indicator:** Warn user of overload/clipping

### 14.5.5 LED/Display Feedback: Play/Rec, Status, Selection

- **LEDs:** Show record ready, sampling, playback, bank select, pad activity
- **OLED/LCD:** Show waveform, sample name, position, parameter values
- **Status Feedback:** Indicate armed, recording, playing, error (e.g., no SD, out of RAM)
