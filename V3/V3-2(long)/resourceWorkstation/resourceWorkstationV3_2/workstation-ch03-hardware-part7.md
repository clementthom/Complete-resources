## 3.78 Introduction to Assembly and Enclosure Design

A workstation is only as good as its physical build.  
A well-assembled, sturdy, and accessible device will last for years, be easy to maintain, and resist the bumps of travel and performance.  
This chapter is a **comprehensive, beginner-friendly, and detailed guide** to assembling your workstation, designing or choosing an enclosure, managing cooling, and ensuring your build is serviceable for the long term.

## 3.80 Choosing and Designing an Enclosure

### 3.80.1 Why the Enclosure Matters

- Protects sensitive electronics from bumps, dust, moisture, and EMI.
- Supports controls and connectors for easy access.
- Affects sound quality (for speakers), thermal management, and aesthetics.

### 3.80.2 Buy vs. Build

- **Pre-Made Enclosures:**  
  - Fast, easy, often metal or ABS plastic (Hammond, Takachi, Gainta brands).
  - Limited size, shape, and customization.
- **DIY/Custom Enclosures:**  
  - Full control over layout, style, and features.
  - Can use metal, wood, acrylic, or 3D-printed parts.
  - More work, but rewarding for unique builds.

### 3.80.3 Size and Shape

- Plan for at least 20–30% more volume than your PCBs and wiring need.
- Allow extra space for airflow, upgrades, and cable bends.
- Consider ergonomics—angled panels for displays and controls are easier to use.

## 3.81 Materials: Metal, Plastic, Wood, 3D Printing

### 3.81.1 Metal Enclosures

- **Aluminum:** Lightweight, strong, excellent EMI shielding.
- **Steel:** Stronger, heavier, harder to machine.
- **Pros:** Durable, good for touring/stage, dissipates heat.
- **Cons:** Needs power tools to drill/cut, can be expensive.

### 3.81.2 Plastic Enclosures

- **ABS/Polycarbonate:** Easy to drill/cut, non-conductive.
- **Pros:** Cheap, lightweight, many sizes.
- **Cons:** Picks up scratches, weaker EMI shielding, can melt with high heat.

### 3.81.3 Wood Enclosures

- **Plywood, MDF, Hardwood:** For vintage or boutique builds.
- **Pros:** Easy to work, attractive, vibration damping.
- **Cons:** No EMI shielding, can swell with moisture, may be heavy.

### 3.81.4 3D-Printed Enclosures

- **PLA/ABS/PETG:** Custom shapes, rapid prototyping.
- **Pros:** Full control over design, replaceable parts, light.
- **Cons:** Lower strength, no EMI shielding unless lined, limited by printer size.

### 3.81.5 Combining Materials

- Many pros use metal chassis with wood side panels or plastic faceplates for looks and function.

## 3.82 Layout Planning: PCB, Controls, and Connectors

### 3.82.1 Start with a Sketch

- Draw your enclosure (paper, software, CAD).
- Place PCBs, controls (knobs, buttons, pads), displays, and jacks.
- Check hand clearance for controls and display readability.

### 3.82.2 PCB Placement

- Mount main boards on standoffs or brackets.
- Keep analog and digital sections apart, avoid running wires over analog audio.
- Leave room for future shields/expansions.

### 3.82.3 Control and Display Placement

- Place most-used controls closest to the user.
- Group similar functions (e.g., all encoders together).
- Put displays at eye level or at an angle for easy viewing.

### 3.82.4 Connector Placement

- Group all audio and power connectors on rear or side.
- Place USB, SD card, and quick-access jacks on front or sides.
- Use recessed or protected connectors for fragile parts.

---

## 3.83 Mounting Boards and Hardware Safely

### 3.83.1 Standoffs and Spacers

- Use nylon or metal standoffs—never let PCBs touch metal enclosure.
- At least 5mm clearance between PCB and case.
- Use locking nuts and washers to prevent loosening.

### 3.83.2 Screws and Fasteners

- Match screw size to mounting holes (M2, M3, #4-40 are common).
- Don’t overtighten; can crack PCB or strip threads.

### 3.83.3 Adhesives

- Hot glue for light parts (wires, LEDs).
- Avoid superglue near electronics—can create fumes and residue.
- Double-sided tape for displays or light panels.

### 3.83.4 Shock/Vibration Protection

- Use rubber grommets or foam tape under sensitive boards.
- Secure all heavy parts (transformers, batteries) with brackets or straps.

---

## 3.84 Access Panels, Service Doors, and Future-Proofing

### 3.84.1 Why Access Matters

- Makes repairs, upgrades, and troubleshooting much easier.
- Allows for replacing SD cards, batteries, fuses, or adding shields.

### 3.84.2 Designing Access Panels

- Hinged doors or removable plates for SD card, USB, or battery.
- Use captive screws (won’t get lost) or tool-free clips for frequent access.
- Mark all access points clearly on the case.

### 3.84.3 Upgrades and Expansion

- Leave a blank panel area or knockout for future connectors.
- Use pin headers or sockets for easy module swapping.

---

## 3.85 Cooling: Passive, Active, and Hybrid Approaches

### 3.85.1 Why Cooling Matters

- Prevents thermal shutdown, data loss, and early failure.
- Audio circuits can drift or distort if overheated.

### 3.85.2 Passive Cooling

- Large heatsinks on CPU, key ICs.
- Vented case (slots or mesh) for natural airflow.
- Place hot components near vents.

### 3.85.3 Active Cooling

- Fans (40mm, 60mm) for high-power CPUs or amps.
- Fan filters to keep dust out.
- Software control: Fan only runs when needed (use Pi GPIO or fan HAT).

### 3.85.4 Hybrid Cooling

- Combine small fan with big heatsink for silent, efficient cooling.
- Use thermal pads or tape for good heat transfer.

---

## 3.86 Vents, Filters, and Airflow Management

### 3.86.1 Where to Place Vents

- Intake at base/front, exhaust at top/rear.
- Avoid placing vents directly above dusty floors/desks.

### 3.86.2 Dust Filters

- Use mesh or foam filters on all intake vents.
- Clean every few months to maintain airflow.

### 3.86.3 Airflow Paths

- Arrange internal parts so air can flow freely from intake to exhaust.
- Use cable ties to keep wires out of airflow.

---

## 3.87 Cable Management, Strain Relief, and Wire Dressing

### 3.87.1 Cable Management

- Bundle wires with zip ties or Velcro straps.
- Route power and signal wires separately where possible.
- Use adhesive-backed cable tie mounts for neat builds.

### 3.87.2 Strain Relief

- Use grommets where wires pass through metal/plastic panels.
- Clamp or tie power cables near entry point to avoid stress on solder joints.

### 3.87.3 Wire Dressing

- Cut all wires to correct length—no tangles or loops.
- Twist pairs of signal wires to reduce noise.
- Color code or label wires for future servicing.

## 3.88 Assembly Sequence: Step-by-Step Guide

### 3.88.1 Dry Fit

- Assemble all parts without power to check fit.
- Verify standoffs, screw holes, and connector alignment.

### 3.88.2 Mount Large Components

- Install power supply, Pi/mainboard, audio boards.
- Secure heavy parts first.

### 3.88.3 Install Controls and Displays

- Mount encoders, buttons, pads, displays, and LEDs to panel.
- Route cables, connect to PCBs.

### 3.88.4 Mount Connectors

- Install audio, MIDI, USB, and power jacks.
- Double-check orientation and labeling.

### 3.88.5 Connect Wiring

- Solder or plug in all internal cables.
- Check for shorts, correct pinout, and strain relief.

### 3.88.6 Final Fastening

- Screw down all boards and panels.
- Double-check for loose parts, missing screws, or misaligned components.

### 3.88.7 Initial Power-On

- Power up with only essential boards connected.
- Check for correct voltages, no smoke/smell, and boot to OS/UI.

### 3.88.8 Full System Test

- Connect all controls, test every button, knob, jack, and display.
- Play audio through all outputs, check for noise/hum.
- Test cooling: Fan spins, heat sinks not too hot.

## 3.89 Common Assembly Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

- **Overtightened screws:** Will crack PCBs or strip threads. Use gentle finger pressure.
- **Loose wires:** Will cause intermittent failures. Always tug-test after crimping/soldering.
- **No strain relief:** Wires may break at solder joints. Use cable clamps/grommets.
- **Misaligned connectors:** Can damage jacks or PCBs. Dry-fit before final mounting.
- **Skipped heatsinks:** Can fry chips. Always install before power-on.
- **No labels:** Future you won’t remember which wire is which! Always label.
- **No access for SD card/USB:** Design panel cutouts for frequent-use parts.

## 3.91 Labeling, Documentation, and Final Inspection

### 3.91.1 Labeling

- Mark all controls, jacks, and switches on the panel.
- Use engraved, printed, or sticker labels.
- Label all internal cables and connectors.

### 3.91.2 Documentation

- Maintain a build log: what parts were used, dates, issues found.
- Keep wiring diagrams, PCB layouts, and datasheets in a folder.
- Save all firmware versions and configuration files.

### 3.91.3 Final Inspection Checklist

- All screws, standoffs, and nuts secure.
- No loose wires or cables.
- All controls and jacks aligned and labeled.
- Cooling system working.
- All power rails at correct voltages.
- No strange noises, smells, or excessive heat after running for 30+ minutes.
