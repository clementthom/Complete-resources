## 12.7 Introduction: Beyond MIDI — Analog, Digital, and Hybrid Control

While MIDI is ubiquitous, many modern and vintage systems use analog and digital protocols for control—especially in modular synthesis, Eurorack, and hybrid workstations.  
Understanding CV/Gate, digital buses, OSC, and protocol bridging is crucial for:
- Building gear that works with the widest range of synths, modules, DAWs, and controllers
- Achieving fast, low-latency, expressive control
- Ensuring robust, safe operation in complex signal chains

This section provides a **detailed, exhaustive, beginner-friendly** reference for CV, digital, networked, and hybrid protocol design.

## 12.8 CV/Gate: Analog Control for Synths and Modularity

### 12.8.1 What is CV/Gate? Historical Roots and Modern Use

- **CV (Control Voltage):** Analog voltage line used to control pitch, cutoff, level, etc.
- **Gate:** Digital signal, HIGH = note on, LOW = note off
- **Trigger:** Short pulse to start envelope, drum, or event
- **Origins:** Moog, ARP, Buchla, Roland (1960s–80s)
- **Modern Use:** Eurorack, modular, analog mono/poly synths, hybrid MIDI/CV gear

### 12.8.2 CV Standards: 1V/Octave, Hz/V, S-Trig, V-Trig

#### 12.8.2.1 1V/Octave (Moog, Eurorack)

- Each additional 1V increases pitch by an octave
- Linear relationship:  
  - 0V = C0, 1V = C1, 2V = C2 ...  
  - 1/12V = 1 semitone

#### 12.8.2.2 Hz/V (Korg, Yamaha vintage)

- Pitch doubles for each additional volt (exponential)
- Used in Korg MS-20, Yamaha CS, others; not compatible with 1V/oct gear

#### 12.8.2.3 S-Trig (Shorting Trigger)

- Signal triggers when line is grounded (LOW = ON)
- Used in Moog, Korg, some vintage gear

#### 12.8.2.4 V-Trig (Voltage Trigger)

- Signal triggers when line goes HIGH (typical 5V or 10V)
- Most modern and Eurorack gear

### 12.8.3 Gate, Trigger, and Clock Signals: Levels, Pulse Width, Specs

#### 12.8.3.1 Typical Levels

| Signal Type | Voltage | Duration           |
|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| Gate        | 0–5V    | Note duration      |
| Trigger     | 5V      | 1–10ms (short pulse)|
| Clock       | 5V      | Regular pulses     |

- Some vintage gear: 10V gates, negative triggers, etc.

#### 12.8.3.2 Pulse Width and Polarity

- Gate: stays HIGH as long as note is held
- Trigger: short positive-going pulse (V-Trig), or short-to-ground (S-Trig)

#### 12.8.3.3 Clock

- Used to sync drum machines, sequencers (e.g., 24 PPQN = 24 pulses per quarter note)

### 12.8.4 CV Output Hardware: DACs, Buffered Op-Amps, Protection

#### 12.8.4.1 DACs for CV

- 12–16 bit DACs (e.g., MCP4922, TLV5618, AD5680, PCM5102 for audio-rate)
- SPI/I2C or parallel interface
- Resolution: 12 bit = 4096 steps, 16 bit = 65536 steps (more is better for pitch!)

#### 12.8.4.2 Output Buffering

- Op-amp buffer after DAC output for low output impedance (<1kΩ, ideally <100Ω)
- Rail-to-rail op-amps for full voltage swing (e.g., TLV2372, OPA2134)

#### 12.8.4.3 Output Range and Scaling

- Eurorack: -5V to +5V or 0–10V
- Scale DAC output (0–3.3V/5V) with op-amp and resistor divider/gain stage

#### 12.8.4.4 Output Protection

- Series resistor (1k–10k) to limit fault current
- Schottky diodes to rails for overvoltage
- TVS diodes for ESD

### 12.8.5 Gate/Trigger Output Hardware: Digital Outs, Level Shifting, Optocouplers

#### 12.8.5.1 Direct MCU Output

- Use MCU GPIO with series resistor for short patch cables (<1m)
- For longer cables or ruggedness: buffer with transistor (2N3904, MOSFET), 74HC14, or similar

#### 12.8.5.2 Level Shifting

- Logic-level shifter (e.g., 74LVC1T45) if MCU is 3.3V but gear expects 5V/10V

#### 12.8.5.3 Optocoupler Buffer

- For maximum isolation/safety: drive optocoupler (e.g., 6N137) to recreate gate/trigger signal at output

#### 12.8.5.4 Pulse Shaping

- Use monostable (“one-shot”) for precise trigger/gate pulse width

### 12.8.6 CV Input Hardware: ADCs, Scaling, Protection, Noise Handling

#### 12.8.6.1 ADC Selection

- 12–16 bit, low noise, high input impedance (e.g., MCP3208, ADS1115, built-in MCU ADC)
- Sample rate: 1–10kHz for live control, higher for audio-rate CV

#### 12.8.6.2 Input Scaling

- Divide down high CVs (-5V/+10V) into ADC input range (0–3.3V/5V)
- Use resistor divider and op-amp buffer

#### 12.8.6.3 Input Protection

- Clamp with Schottky or TVS diodes, series resistor
- Filter with small cap (100nF) to ground for noise reduction

#### 12.8.6.4 Noise and Offset Handling

### 12.8.7 Calibration and Compensation: Tuning, Drift, Range

- Tune DAC/ADC scale for accurate 1V/oct, Hz/V response
- Store calibration values (offset, gain) in nonvolatile memory
- Compensate for temperature drift: use precision references, op-amps

### 12.8.8 Polyphony, Voice Allocation, and CV/Gate Multiplexing

- Multiple CV/gate pairs for polyphonic control (4, 8, 16 voices)
- Voice allocation: Round robin, last note priority, reassign on release
- Multiplexers (CD4051, DG409) or analog switches to expand outputs

### 12.8.9 CV/Gate Signal Routing, Patchbays, and Normalling

- Use jack fields or patchbays for flexible routing (3.5mm mono, banana, 1/4”)
- Normalled jacks: default signal route unless cable inserted
- Use “soft” relays (analog switches) for digital patching

- I2C: 2-wire (SDA/SCL), up to 400kHz (standard), 1MHz (fast), or more (FM+)
- Address up to 127 devices per bus (realistically fewer for reliable operation)
- Pullup resistors (2.2k–10k) required on SDA/SCL
- Used for control surfaces, sensors, multiplexers, some digital modules
- “Tron” protocols (Teenage Engineering OP-1, Mutable Instruments): custom I2C extensions for modular gear

### 12.9.3 UART for Serial Control: Sync, Lighting, Custom Gear

- UART/USART: classic serial, 9600–115200+ baud
- Used for MIDI, DMX lighting, custom protocols between modules
- Level shifters (RS232, RS485, TTL) as needed
- Parity, stop bits, error handling per application

### 12.9.4 GPIO Triggering: Direct Digital Control, Debouncing, and Speed

- Use MCU GPIO for digital triggers, gates, clocks
- Firmware debouncing for button/switch input (10–50ms typical)
- High-speed triggering (audio-rate, 10kHz+) possible with minimal code, direct register access

## 12.10 OSC, RTP, and Network Control

### 12.10.1 Open Sound Control (OSC): Structure, UDP, TCP

- OSC: Open, extensible protocol for musical control over network (Ethernet, WiFi)
- Uses UDP (default, low-latency) or TCP (reliable, more overhead)
- Addressing: “/synth/osc1/freq”, “/mixer/track2/volume”, etc.

### 12.10.2 OSC Addressing, Bundles, and Data Types

- Address: Hierarchical path, like URLs
- Bundles: Group messages with a timestamp for synchronized delivery

```
/synth/filter/cutoff, f 0.75
/mixer/track1/mute, T
```

### 12.10.3 Network Distribution: RTP, Multicast, and Wireless

- RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol): Used for MIDI and OSC over LAN/WAN (Apple, iOS, etc.)
- Multicast: Send to multiple receivers simultaneously
- WiFi/Ethernet: Standard for OSC, but introduces variable latency/jitter

### 12.10.4 OSC in Embedded and DAW Environments

- Embedded: Use lwIP, uIP, or other lightweight TCP/IP stacks
- Libraries: liblo (C), python-osc, JavaScript, JUCE, TouchOSC, Lemur, Max/MSP

- Features: glide/portamento, retrig, envelope/gate modes, CC to CV mapping

#### 12.11.1.1 Example: MIDI Note to CV

- MIDI note 60 (C4): CV out = (60-0)/12 = 5.0V (for 1V/oct standard)
- Gate out = HIGH while key held, LOW when released

### 12.11.2 CV/Gate-to-MIDI: ADC Timing, Note Detection, Velocity Sensing

- Reads analog CV, detects pitch, outputs MIDI note

### 12.11.3 MIDI↔OSC Bridges: Gateways, Mapping, and Latency

- Software or hardware bridges (e.g., TouchOSC Bridge, Lemur Daemon)
- Map MIDI events to OSC commands and vice versa
- Latency: OSC and RTP-MIDI can be sub-millisecond on LAN, but higher on WiFi/internet

### 12.11.4 Hybrid Workstation Protocols and Routing

- Many workstations route MIDI, CV, OSC, USB, and more internally
- Flexible mapping/routing engine: user can map any input to any output
- Scenes, presets, and macros for complex control

### 12.11.5 Protocol Conversion: Challenges and Best Practices

- **Timing:** Match timing resolution and event processing between protocols (e.g., MIDI 1ms, CV microseconds)
- **Resolution:** MIDI 7/14-bit vs. CV analog (infinite, practically 12–16 bit)
- **Expressiveness:** Map per-note CC, aftertouch, MPE, etc., to CVs
- **Safety:** Protect against overvoltage, ground loops, missing ground/earth
- **Robustness:** Handle missing messages, buffer overflow, protocol errors
