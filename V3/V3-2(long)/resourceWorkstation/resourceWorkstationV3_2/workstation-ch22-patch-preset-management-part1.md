## 22.1 Introduction: The Importance of Patch and Preset Management

Patch and preset management is a cornerstone of synthesizer and workstation usability.  
It enables musicians to:
- Save and recall favorite sounds instantly, across projects and performances.
- Organize sounds into banks, libraries, and set lists for rehearsal, studio, and stage.
- Share, import/export, and back up creative work.
- Evolve sounds over time, compare versions, and prevent accidental overwrites.

A robust patch management system balances flexibility, speed, searchability, and reliability—while supporting legacy formats and modern, metadata-rich workflows.

## 22.2 Core Concepts: Patch, Preset, Bank, Library, and Project

### 22.2.1 What is a Patch? (Synthesis, Sampler, Hybrid)

- **Patch:** A complete set of parameters defining a sound or instrument.
  - For a synth: Oscillator, filter, envelope, LFO, FX, modulation, macro, routing, etc.
  - For a sampler: Sample references, key/velocity zones, root note, loop points, tuning, envelopes, FX.
  - For hybrid: Combination of synthesis and sample data, plus all relevant parameters.

#### 22.2.1.1 Example: Synth Patch Structure (JSON)

```json
{
  "osc1": {"wave": "saw", "tune": 0, "level": 0.8},
  "filter": {"type": "lp24", "cutoff": 1200, "res": 0.2},
  "env1": {"attack": 0.01, "decay": 0.2, "sustain": 0.7, "release": 0.3},
  "lfo": {"freq": 5.5, "depth": 0.1},
  "mod_matrix": [
    {"source": "lfo", "dest": "filter.cutoff", "amount": 0.5}
  ],
  "fx": {"chorus": true, "reverb": 0.2},
  "metadata": {"author": "Alice", "date": "2025-06-22"}
}
```

### 22.2.2 Presets vs. User Patches: Factory, User, Write-Protect

- **Factory Presets:** Read-only, provided by manufacturer; showcase capabilities, safe from overwrite.
- **User Patches:** Editable, saveable by user; stored in flash, disk, or user partition.
- **Write-Protect:** Prevent accidental overwrite; UI toggle or hardware switch.
- **Init Patch:** Blank or neutral patch for starting sound design.

### 22.2.3 Banks, Libraries, and Projects: Hierarchy and Organization

- **Bank:** Collection of patches (e.g., 128 per bank, 8 banks); may be hardware-limited.
- **Library:** Larger, possibly hierarchical collection—multiple banks, user/factory, genre/style.
- **Project:** Complete environment—patches, samples, sequences, mixer, automation, etc.
- **Set List:** User-defined order of patches for performance.

#### 22.2.3.1 Example: Bank Directory Layout

```
/Banks/
  /UserBank1/
    001_bright_pad.json
    002_soft_bass.json
  /FactoryBankA/
    001_init_patch.json
    002_analog_lead.json
```

### 22.2.4 Multitimbral and Multi-Part Patch Storage

- **Multitimbral:** Multiple sound engines/parts (e.g., 16 parts in workstation); each with its own patch.
- **Multi-Part Storage:** Save/recall all part patches as a single setup (multi/combination/performance).
- **Dependencies:** Multi-patch setups must track sample, FX, and routing dependencies.

### 22.2.5 Projects: Complete Environment Snapshots

- **Snapshot:** All patches, sequences, mixes, and user edits captured for instant recall.
- **Versioning:** Allow “save as” or version history for project evolution.

## 22.3 Patch/Preset Data Formats

### 22.3.1 Binary, Hex, and Proprietary Formats (Legacy, Modern)

- **Binary:** Compact, fast, but not human-readable; used in legacy hardware (e.g., DX7 .syx, Roland .prg).
- **Hex (SysEx):** MIDI System Exclusive dumps; portable, but can be obscure.
- **Proprietary:** Vendor-specific, often undocumented; may require conversion tools.

#### 22.3.1.1 Example: SysEx Dump (Hex)

```
F0 43 00 09 20 00 7F 7F 00 10 00 00 ... F7
```

### 22.3.2 Text-Based Formats: XML, JSON, YAML, Human-Readable

- **XML:** Structured, supports metadata, widely used in software (e.g., Ableton, Kontakt).
- **JSON:** Human-readable, lightweight, easy to parse; good for modern embedded/desktop.
- **YAML:** More readable for humans, used for configs and user-editable patches.
- **CSV/INI:** For simple parameter lists; rarely used for complex patches.

#### 22.3.2.1 Example: Patch in XML

```xml
<patch>
  <osc1 type="saw" tune="0" level="0.8"/>
  <filter type="lp24" cutoff="1200" res="0.2"/>
  <env1 attack="0.01" decay="0.2" sustain="0.7" release="0.3"/>
</patch>
```

### 22.3.3 Embedded Metadata: Author, Date, Version, Tags

- **Author:** Creator name, useful for collaboration and attribution.
- **Date:** Creation and modified timestamps.
- **Version:** Patch schema or software version; helps with migration.
- **Tags:** Genre, mood, instrument type, rating (for search/filtering).

### 22.3.4 Sample References and Dependencies

- **Relative Paths:** Patches reference samples by relative path for portability.
- **Dependency List:** Patch includes list of required samples, FX, macros, and other patches.
- **Missing File Handling:** UI warns user if referenced sample/FX is missing; offers relink or ignore.

### 22.3.5 Versioning, Backward/Forward Compatibility, and Migration

- **Schema Evolution:** Patch format changes over time; embed version, provide migration scripts.
- **Backward Compatibility:** New firmware loads old patches, applies default for new parameters.
- **Forward Compatibility:** Old firmware may ignore unknown/new parameters.

#### 22.3.5.1 Example: Patch Versioning

```json
{
  "schema_version": "2.1",
  "params": {...}
}
```

### 22.3.6 Encryption, Protection, and Copy Management

- **Encryption:** Protect proprietary patches or user data (AES, RSA, custom).
- **Copy Management:** Tag patches as copy-protected or watermark for licensing.
- **Decryption UI:** Prompt user for key/password if protected.

## 22.4 Patch Architecture and Storage Design

### 22.4.1 Internal Patch Structure: Parameters, Mod Matrix, FX, Routing

- **Parameters:** All sound engine settings (osc, filter, env, LFO, FX, mixer, macro, etc.).
- **Modulation Matrix:** List of modulation routes (source, destination, amount, curve).
- **FX and Routing:** FX chain, send/return levels, output routing.
- **Macros:** User-assignable controls mapped to multiple parameters.

#### 22.4.1.1 Example: Mod Matrix Entry

```json
{"source": "modwheel", "destination": "filter.cutoff", "amount": 0.7}
```

### 22.4.2 Serialization: Saving/Loading to Disk, Flash, or Cloud

- **Serialization:** Convert patch struct to file/buffer for storage.
- **Atomic Save:** Write to temp file, then rename to prevent corruption.
- **Cloud Save:** Serialize, encrypt, and upload patch to cloud service or backup.
- **Compression:** Optionally compress patch for storage efficiency.

### 22.4.3 Patch Banks: Slot/Bucket, Flat, Hierarchical, and Tag-Based

- **Slot/Bucket:** Fixed number of slots (e.g., 128 per bank); fast recall, hardware compatibility.
- **Flat:** Unlimited patches in a directory; no slot limit, but slower navigation.
- **Hierarchical:** Directory tree for genres, users, or types.
- **Tag-Based:** Virtual folders by tag (e.g., “Bass”, “Pad”, “Favorites”).

#### 22.4.3.1 Example: Tag-Based Virtual Bank

```
/Banks/Bass/
  bright_bass.json
  deep_sub.json
/Banks/Pad/
  soft_pad.json
  air_strings.json
```

### 22.4.4 Patch Indexing, Fast Recall, and Search

- **Indexing:** At startup or file add, scan patches, extract metadata/tags, create fast lookup index.
- **Fast Recall:** Preload next/previous patch, cache last N patches in RAM.
- **Search:** Search box, filter by tag, author, date, type, or custom fields.

#### 22.4.4.1 Example: Patch Index (SQLite Table)

| id | name         | bank    | author | tags        | date        |
|----|--------------|---------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 1  | bright_pad   | User1   | Alice  | pad,bright  | 2025-06-22  |
| 2  | deep_sub     | User2   | Bob    | bass,deep   | 2025-06-21  |

### 22.4.5 Storage Limits: Patch Size, Bank Size, File System Constraints

- **Patch Size:** Typically 1–16KB (JSON/XML), larger if sample data is embedded.
- **Bank Size:** Hardware may limit to 128/256/512 patches per bank; software often unlimited.
- **File System:** FAT32 limits (4GB/file, 2TB/partition), exFAT/ext4 preferred for large libraries.
- **Migration:** Tools to split/merge banks for compatibility with legacy hardware.

## 22.5 Patch Recall, Comparison, and Live Performance

### 22.5.1 Patch Recall: Instant, Seamless, and Pre-Loading

- **Instant Recall:** Patches load in <100ms for live performance; pre-load heads/tails for sample-based patches.
- **Seamless Recall:** No audio glitch/cutoff; crossfade old/new patch if needed.
- **Pre-Loading:** Next patch in set list is preloaded for fast switching.

### 22.5.2 Patch Comparison: A/B, Undo/Redo, Quick Swap

- **A/B Comparison:** Toggle between two sound states; “A/B” button in UI for auditioning edits.
- **Undo/Redo:** Multi-level, per-parameter or per-patch; allows exploration without risk.
- **Quick Swap:** Swap to previous/next patch instantly; useful for blind testing or live tweaks.

### 22.5.3 Live Set Lists, Favorites, and Fast Access

- **Set Lists:** Ordered list of patches for gig or rehearsal; easily navigable.
- **Favorites:** Star or mark patches for quick recall.
- **Fast Access:** Hardware buttons, footswitches, or MIDI program change select patches instantly.

### 22.5.4 Patch Morphing and Interpolation

- **Morphing:** Interpolate between two or more patches; continuous or stepwise.
- **Macro Morph:** Assign morph to knob, pedal, or automation lane.
- **Parameter Mapping:** Some parameters (e.g., wave select) may morph discretely; others (filter, env) interpolate smoothly.

### 22.5.5 Patch Recall in Sequencer and Song Context

- **Sequencer Integration:** Song patterns/regions can recall patches automatically.
- **Scene Recall:** Multi-part/multi-patch state saved with song or scene; supports “total recall.”
- **Automation:** Patch changes can be automated with timeline events (MIDI PC, DAW, or internal).
