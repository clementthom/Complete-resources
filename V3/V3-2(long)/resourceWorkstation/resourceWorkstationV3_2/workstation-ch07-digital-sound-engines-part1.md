## 7.1 Introduction: What is a Digital Sound Engine?

A **digital sound engine** is the part of a workstation or synthesizer that generates, processes, and mixes audio using digital algorithms.  
There are many types—PCM, wavetable, FM, additive, and sampling are among the most important.  
Understanding these engines is essential for building, programming, or using modern workstation synths.

## 7.2 How Digital Audio Works: Sampling, Quantization, and Playback

### 7.2.1 Sampling

- Audio is a continuous (analog) signal.
- **Sampling** means measuring the signal at regular intervals (rate = samples per second, Hz).
- **CD quality:** 44,100 samples/sec (44.1kHz), 16 bits per sample.

### 7.2.2 Quantization

- Each sample is stored as a number (integer or float).
- More bits = higher dynamic range, less noise.

### 7.2.3 Digital-to-Analog Conversion

- A **DAC** converts digital samples back to analog voltage for speakers/headphones.

### 7.2.4 Playback Flow Diagram

```plaintext
[Sample Memory] --> [Read Pointer] --> [Volume/Envelope] --> [Mixer] --> [DAC]
```

## 7.3 PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) Synthesis

### 7.3.1 What is PCM?

- The simplest form of digital audio playback.
- Stores raw digital audio samples (not compressed or synthesized).
- “Sampler” engines play back PCM data at different rates/pitches.

### 7.3.2 PCM in Classic and Modern Workstations

- **Fairlight CMI, Emulator, Akai S-series:** Early PCM samplers.
- **Korg, Yamaha, Roland, Kurzweil:** Modern workstations use PCM for pianos, drums, and realistic sounds.

### 7.3.3 PCM Playback: Block Diagrams and Data Flow

```plaintext
[Start Address] -> [Sample RAM/ROM] -> [Read/Increment Pointer] -> [DAC]
```

- The engine reads samples in order from memory.
- **Sample rate conversion**: Change rate to shift pitch (stretch/compress in time).

### 7.3.4 Coding a Simple PCM Playback Engine (Step-by-Step)

#### 7.3.4.1 Data Structures

```c
typedef struct {
    const int16_t* data;    // Pointer to sample data
    uint32_t length;        // Number of samples
    uint32_t position;      // Current playback index
    float volume;           // Volume (0.0 - 1.0)
    int playing;            // 1 = playing, 0 = stopped
} PCMVoice;
```

#### 7.3.4.2 Main Loop (Pseudocode)

```c
for each output sample {
    if (voice.playing) {
        output += voice.data[voice.position] * voice.volume;
        voice.position++;
        if (voice.position >= voice.length) voice.playing = 0; // Stop at end
    }
}
```

#### 7.3.4.3 Handling Polyphony

- Use an array of `PCMVoice` structs, sum all active voices.

#### 7.3.4.4 Example: Starting a Note

```c
void pcm_note_on(PCMVoice* v, const int16_t* sample, uint32_t len, float vol) {
    v->data = sample;
    v->length = len;
    v->position = 0;
    v->volume = vol;
    v->playing = 1;
}
```

#### 7.3.4.5 Handling Sample Rate and Pitch

- To play a sample at a higher or lower pitch, change the rate at which you increment `position`:

```c
float increment = base_sample_rate / output_sample_rate * pitch_ratio;
voice.position += increment;
```

- For non-integer positions, use interpolation (see below).

### 7.3.5 File Formats for PCM (WAV, AIFF, RAW)

#### 7.3.5.1 WAV

- Most common for PCM.
- RIFF header, little-endian.
- Can be 8, 16, 24, 32 bits, mono or stereo.

#### 7.3.5.2 AIFF

- Big-endian, Apple/old school.

#### 7.3.5.3 RAW

- No header, just samples. You must know rate/format.

#### 7.3.5.4 Loading PCM Files (Pseudocode)

```c
// Open file, read header, verify format
// Allocate buffer, read samples into memory
// Store pointer and length in PCMVoice/sample struct
```

### 7.3.6 Handling Sample Rate, Bit Depth, and Endianness

#### 7.3.6.1 Sample Rate Conversion

- If your hardware runs at 48kHz and the sample is 44.1kHz, you must resample or adjust playback rate.

#### 7.3.6.2 Bit Depth Conversion

- 8-bit unsigned to 16-bit signed: `(sample - 128) << 8`
- 24-bit packed: Special handling; often stored as 3 bytes/sample.

#### 7.3.6.3 Endianness

- Little-endian (Intel/ARM) vs. big-endian (old Mac, AIFF).
- Swap bytes as needed when loading samples.

### 7.3.7 Looping, One-Shot, and Envelope Control in PCM

#### 7.3.7.1 Loop Types

- **One-Shot:** Play once, then stop.
- **Forward Loop:** Loop from point A to B.
- **Ping-Pong:** Play A->B, then B->A, repeat.

#### 7.3.7.2 Envelope

- Apply ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) to PCM amplitude for natural sound.
- Envelopes can be implemented as simple linear ramps or more complex curves.

```c
voice.volume = envelope_get_next(&voice.env);
```

#### 7.3.7.3 Looping Example

```c
if (voice.position == loop_end) {
    if (pingpong) reverse = !reverse;
    voice.position = loop_start;
}
```

### 7.3.8 Multi-Voice PCM and Polyphony

#### 7.3.8.1 Mixing Multiple Voices

- Sum all active voice outputs before sending to DAC.

#### 7.3.8.2 Voice Allocation

- On `note_on`, find a free voice (or steal oldest if all are busy).
- On `note_off`, mark as released (envelope handles fade out).

#### 7.3.8.3 Dynamic Voice Management

- Track voice state (idle, playing, releasing, stopped).
- Efficiently handle 8, 16, 32, or more voices for chords, drums, etc.

### 7.3.9 Memory and Performance Optimization

#### 7.3.9.1 Memory Layout

- Use contiguous sample buffers for cache efficiency.
- Align buffers to 4 or 8 bytes for DMA access.

#### 7.3.9.2 Fixed-Point Arithmetic

- For MCUs without FPU, use Q15 or Q31 fixed-point for mixing and envelopes.

#### 7.3.9.3 Avoiding Audio Glitches

- All sample, envelope, and mixing calculations must finish before next output frame.
- Use double-buffering or DMA for output to DAC.

## 7.4 Wavetable Synthesis

### 7.4.1 What is Wavetable Synthesis?

- Uses a table of single-cycle waveforms (wavetables).
- The playback pointer moves through the table at different speeds (pitch).
- Can morph or switch between tables for evolving timbres.

### 7.4.2 History and Notable Instruments

- **PPG Wave, Waldorf Microwave, Ensoniq Mirage, Korg Wavestation:** Famous wavetable synths.
- Modern plugins (Serum, Vital) use advanced wavetable morphing.

### 7.4.3 Wavetable Data Structures: Tables, Interpolation, and Morphing

#### 7.4.3.1 Basic Wavetable

```c
#define TABLE_SIZE 2048
float wavetable[TABLE_SIZE]; // One cycle of waveform
```

#### 7.4.3.2 Reading the Table

- For each sample, increment a phase accumulator:
```c
phase += freq * TABLE_SIZE / sample_rate;
if (phase >= TABLE_SIZE) phase -= TABLE_SIZE;
output = wavetable[(int)phase];
```

#### 7.4.3.3 Interpolation

- For better sound, interpolate between table entries:
```c
int idx = (int)phase;
float frac = phase - idx;
float s0 = wavetable[idx];
float s1 = wavetable[(idx+1) % TABLE_SIZE];
output = s0 + (s1 - s0) * frac; // Linear interpolation
```

#### 7.4.3.4 Multiple Tables / Morphing

- Store a 2D array: `tables[num_tables][TABLE_SIZE]`
- Crossfade or interpolate between tables for evolving timbres.

### 7.4.4 Coding a Simple Wavetable Synth (Step-by-Step)

#### 7.4.4.1 Data Structures

```c
typedef struct {
    float* table; // Pointer to the wavetable
    float phase;  // Current position
    float phase_inc; // How much to increment each sample
    float volume;
    // Optional: morphing, envelope, etc.
} WTVoice;
```

#### 7.4.4.2 Note On/Off Logic

```c
void wt_note_on(WTVoice* v, float* table, float freq, float sr, float vol) {
    v->table = table;
    v->phase = 0;
    v->phase_inc = freq * TABLE_SIZE / sr;
    v->volume = vol;
}
```

#### 7.4.4.3 Main Loop

```c
for each output sample {
    output += v->table[(int)v->phase] * v->volume;
    v->phase += v->phase_inc;
    if (v->phase >= TABLE_SIZE) v->phase -= TABLE_SIZE;
}
```

#### 7.4.4.4 Adding Interpolation

- See previous interpolation code.

#### 7.4.4.5 Morphing Example

```c
float* tableA = ...; float* tableB = ...;
float morph = 0.5f; // 0 = tableA, 1 = tableB
float sA = tableA[(int)phase];
float sB = tableB[(int)phase];
output = (1-morph)*sA + morph*sB;
```

### 7.4.5 Modulation and Dynamic Table Selection

- Modulate wavetable position with LFO, envelope, key tracking, velocity, or external controller.
- Dynamic selection enables complex evolving sounds.

### 7.4.6 Multi-Voice Wavetable and Performance Tricks

- Use a pool of `WTVoice` structs, sum output for polyphony.
- Optimize phase increment and interpolation with fixed-point math for MCUs.
- Pre-calculate tables for different waveforms (sine, square, saw, custom).
