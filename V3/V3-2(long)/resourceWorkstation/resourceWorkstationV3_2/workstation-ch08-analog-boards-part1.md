## 8.1 Introduction: Why Analog Matters in a Digital Workstation

Even in an all-digital workstation, analog circuitry is essential for interfacing with the real world.  
Analog boards handle:
- Audio input (instruments, mics, line-in)
- Audio output (to speakers, amps, headphones)
- Mixing, summing, gain staging, and filtering before/after digital processing
- Level shifting and impedance matching
- Creative coloration or “analog warmth”

A solid understanding of analog design is critical for building a reliable, great-sounding workstation.  
This chapter is **beginner-friendly, step-by-step, and exhaustive**—explaining every concept needed for practical analog audio boards.

## 8.2 Analog Audio Signal Basics

### 8.2.1 What is an Analog Signal?

- An **analog signal** is a continuously varying voltage or current representing sound waves in the real world.
- Audio signals typically range from a few millivolts (mics) to several volts (line or synth outputs).

### 8.2.2 Voltage, Current, and Audio Ranges

- **Voltage:** Most audio circuits use signals between -15V and +15V (modular synth), or -1V to +1V (line level).
- **Current:** Generally low (microamps to milliamps), except in power amps or some special circuits.
- **Frequency Range:** Human hearing is 20Hz–20kHz. Audio circuits are often designed for 10Hz–50kHz to ensure fidelity.

### 8.2.3 Signal Levels

| Signal Type   | Typical Level      | Use Case                 |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Microphone    | 1–10 mV           | Mics, DI boxes           |
| Instrument    | 100 mV–1 V        | Guitars, synths          |
| Line (pro)    | +4 dBu (~1.23 V)  | Studio gear, mixers      |
| Line (cons.)  | -10 dBV (~0.316 V)| Consumer, hi-fi          |
| Eurorack      | ±5V or ±10V       | Modular synths           |

- **dBu** and **dBV**: standard units for audio voltage levels.

### 8.2.4 Balanced vs. Unbalanced Signals

- **Unbalanced:** One signal wire + ground (e.g., TS, RCA). More prone to noise over long cables.
- **Balanced:** Two signal wires (hot/cold) + ground (e.g., TRS, XLR). Cancels out noise—preferred for pro audio.

### 8.2.5 Cables, Connectors, and Shielding

- **TS (Tip-Sleeve):** Mono, unbalanced (guitar cable)
- **TRS (Tip-Ring-Sleeve):** Stereo unbalanced, or mono balanced (headphones, pro gear)
- **XLR:** Balanced, rugged, pro mics and gear
- **RCA:** Consumer, unbalanced (hi-fi, CD, mixer)
- **Shielding:** Foil/braid in cable prevents hum and interference.

## 8.3 Op-Amps: The Workhorse of Analog Audio

### 8.3.1 Op-Amp Basics

- **Op-amp = Operational Amplifier**
- IC with differential input (IN+, IN-) and high-impedance output.
- Can amplify, buffer, or filter audio signals.

#### 8.3.1.1 Symbol and Pinout

```
           ______
IN- ----|      \
IN+ ----|       )---- OUT
        |______/
            |
           V-
```

- Common packages: DIP-8, SOIC-8, TSSOP
- Power: ±15V, ±12V, ±5V, or single supply

### 8.3.2 Inverting, Non-Inverting, and Buffer Circuits

#### 8.3.2.1 Inverting Amplifier

- Input to IN-, reference (ground or virtual ground) to IN+
- Output phase inverted, gain set by resistor ratio

```plaintext
   IN --[Rin]---+----|(-)   |\
                |    |      | \____ OUT
               [Rf]  +------|+)
                |           |/
               GND
```
- Gain = -Rf/Rin

#### 8.3.2.2 Non-Inverting Amplifier

- Input to IN+, feedback to IN-

```plaintext
   IN ------|+      |\
            |       | \____ OUT
           [R1]-----|-) 
           [R2]     |/
            |
           GND
```
- Gain = 1 + (R1/R2)

#### 8.3.2.3 Buffer (Voltage Follower)

- IN+ = signal, IN- = OUT
- Output follows input, high input impedance, low output impedance.

### 8.3.3 Op-Amp Parameters: Slew Rate, Noise, Bandwidth, Power

| Parameter     | What it Means               | Typical Audio Values      |
|---------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Slew Rate     | Max speed of output change  | >0.5 V/µs (audio), >5 V/µs (hi-fi) |
| Noise         | Output noise level          | <10 nV/√Hz (low-noise)   |
| Bandwidth     | Frequency with -3dB drop    | >100kHz for audio        |
| Input Offset  | Voltage error at zero input | <5 mV for precision      |
| Power Supply  | Voltage range the chip accepts | ±5V to ±18V             |

### 8.3.4 Choosing Op-Amps for Audio

- **TL072, NE5532:** Cheap, decent for line-level audio
- **OPA2134, LM4562:** Hi-fi grade, low noise, high slew rate
- **LF353, MC33078:** Balanced for synths, modulars

#### 8.3.4.1 Considerations

- Lower noise for preamps, higher bandwidth for high-fidelity paths
- Rail-to-rail output for low-voltage designs (e.g., ±5V or single 5V)

### 8.3.5 Proper Op-Amp Powering and Decoupling

- Bypass/decouple each op-amp IC with 100nF (0.1µF) ceramic cap as close as possible to power pins.
- Add 10–47µF electrolytic nearby for extra filtering.
- Keep power traces short and wide.

## 8.4 Mixers: Summing, Level, and Pan Circuits

### 8.4.1 Summing Amplifiers and Virtual Earth Mixers

- **Summing amp:** Combines multiple audio inputs into one output.
- Uses an inverting op-amp with each input through its own resistor.

```plaintext
IN1 --[R1]--+
IN2 --[R2]--+---|(-)   |\
IN3 --[R3]--+   |      | \____ OUT
                  +----|+)
                  |    |/
                 GND
```
- Output = -(IN1/R1 + IN2/R2 + IN3/R3) * Rf

### 8.4.2 Passive vs. Active Mixing

- **Passive mixer:** Resistors only, no amplification—loses gain, can load down sources.
- **Active mixer:** Uses op-amps—unity or boosted gain, low output impedance.

### 8.4.3 Channel Strips: Level, Pan, and Mute Circuits

- **Level (Volume):** Simple potentiometer before or after op-amp.
- **Pan:** Dual-gang pot or crossfader circuit, or two op-amp buffers.
- **Mute:** Switch or analog switch IC to cut signal.

### 8.4.4 Stereo and Mono Mixing

- **Mono to Stereo:** Duplicate or pan single input to both outputs.
- **Stereo to Mono:** Sum L+R (with resistors to avoid overload).

### 8.4.5 Voltage-Controlled Amplifiers (VCA)

- Use OTA (e.g., LM13700), SSM2164, or THAT2180 for voltage-controlled level (automation, envelopes, sidechain).
- VCAs are key for dynamic mixing and effects.

## 8.5 Signal Routing and Switching

### 8.5.1 Analog Switch ICs

- CMOS: 4051 (8-way mux), 4066 (quad bilateral switch)
- Precision: DG419, MAX4xx series—lower ON resistance, better audio quality

#### 8.5.1.1 Example: 4051 Multiplexer

- 8 inputs, 1 output (or vice versa)
- Digital control selects which input is routed to output

### 8.5.2 Relays vs. Solid-State Switches

- **Relays:** Mechanical, click when switching, handle high voltage/current, perfect isolation, slow.
- **Solid-State:** Silent, fast, limited voltage range, sometimes inject small charge at switch time (audio “pop”).

### 8.5.3 Multiplexers, Demultiplexers, and Crosspoint Switches

- **Multiplexer (Mux):** Select one of many inputs.
- **Demultiplexer (Demux):** Route input to one of many outputs.
- **Crosspoint Switch:** Any input to any output (matrix mixer, patch bay ICs like MT8808).

### 8.5.4 Patchbays and Jack Field Design

- **Patchbay:** Panel with jacks for flexible signal routing.
- **TT/Bantam, 1/4” TRS, 3.5mm:** Common formats.
- **Normalled:** Default internal connection unless plug inserted.

### 8.5.5 Digital Control of Analog Routing

- Use MCU or FPGA to control analog switches or relays:  
  - GPIO outputs drive control pins
  - I2C expanders (e.g., PCF8574) for many switches
  - SPI shift registers for large routing matrices
