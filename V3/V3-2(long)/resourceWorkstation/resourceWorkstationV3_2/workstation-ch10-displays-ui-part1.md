## 10.1 Introduction: The Role of Visual UI in Workstation Design

Visual displays are the bridge between complex digital systems and the human user.  
A well-designed display system makes the workstation accessible, intuitive, and powerful.  
Modern workstations use a variety of display types, from basic monochrome OLEDs to full-color touch TFTs and even E-Ink for ultra-low-power or unique looks.

**Good visual UI hardware should be:**
- Readable in all lighting conditions
- Responsive and low-latency
- Electrically and mechanically reliable
- Expandable for future features (e.g., touch, color, animation)

This part is a **detailed, beginner-friendly, and exhaustive guide** to display hardware for embedded and workstation systems.

## 10.3 Electrical Interfaces and Protocols

### 10.3.1 Parallel vs. Serial (SPI, I2C, QSPI, MIPI DSI)

#### 10.3.1.1 Parallel

- Multiple data lines (8–24), plus control lines (RS, WR, RD, CS, RESET)
- High speed, but many MCU pins and complex routing
- Used for older or high-resolution displays (often on 32-bit MCUs or FPGAs)

#### 10.3.1.2 SPI

- Serial Peripheral Interface: SCLK, MOSI, MISO, CS
- 1–8 Mbps typical, up to 50+ Mbps with fast MCUs
- Most small OLED/TFTs use SPI; lower pin count, easier routing

#### 10.3.1.3 I2C

- Two-wire (SCL, SDA), slower (up to 1MHz)
- Used for small OLEDs (SSD1306), segment displays, sensors
- Limited bandwidth for high-res graphics, but great for status or low-update-rate UI

#### 10.3.1.4 QSPI (Quad SPI)

- Uses 4 data lines for higher speed (used in some fast TFTs, flash memory)

#### 10.3.1.5 MIPI DSI

- Mobile/consumer protocol for very high resolution/color (phones, tablets)
- Not common in hobby/DIY, but used in Raspberry Pi, some SoCs and pro gear

### 10.3.2 Display Driver ICs: SSD1306, ILI9341, RA8875, ST7735, UC1701, etc.

#### 10.3.2.1 SSD1306

- Classic character LCD, 16x2, 20x4, parallel or I2C backpack

### 10.3.3 Timing, Refresh, and Bandwidth Considerations

#### 10.3.3.1 Frame Rate

- 30–60Hz typical for smooth UI; lower for E-Ink or slow MCUs
- Calculate bandwidth:  
  - 128x64x1bpp @ 60Hz ≈ 60KB/s  
  - 320x240x16bpp @ 60Hz ≈ 9MB/s

#### 10.3.3.2 Partial Updates

- Only redraw changed regions to save bandwidth and CPU
- Important on slow links (I2C, slow SPI)

#### 10.3.3.3 DMA and Hardware Acceleration

- DMA: Offload data transfer from CPU to hardware (SPI DMA for TFTs)
- Graphics acceleration: Some drivers (RA8875) draw shapes/fonts in hardware

### 10.3.4 Signal Integrity: Trace Routing, Impedance, and EMI

#### 10.3.4.1 Trace Routing

- Keep high-speed traces short, matched length for parallel
- Route SPI/I2C away from noisy power or digital lines

#### 10.3.4.2 Impedance Matching

- For fast displays, match trace impedance (controlled-width, ground return nearby) to avoid reflections

#### 10.3.4.3 EMI and Crosstalk

- Use ground planes, keep display cables short, shield if needed
- Avoid long ribbon cables for fast parallel/SPI unless properly terminated

### 10.3.5 Level Shifting and Voltage Compatibility

#### 10.3.5.1 Voltage Mismatch

- Many OLED/TFTs are 3.3V logic, some MCUs are 5V
- Use level shifters (74LVC245, TXB0108, resistor dividers for SPI)

#### 10.3.5.2 Open-Drain/Collector

- I2C is open-drain; can mix 3.3V/5V safely with proper pull-ups

#### 10.3.5.3 Backlight Power

- White LEDs need 3–5V, up to 40–100mA; use FET or dedicated driver for PWM dimming

### 10.3.6 Backlight and Power Supply Design

#### 10.3.6.1 Backlight Drivers

- Resistor limits current for simple backlights (small TFTs)
- For bigger displays, use constant-current drivers (PT4115, AP3032, dedicated ICs)

#### 10.3.6.2 Dimming

- Use PWM on backlight enable pin or drive FET with MCU PWM output

#### 10.3.6.3 Power Budget

- Bright TFTs can draw hundreds of mA; check supply capacity
- OLEDs use less power for dark images, more for bright/full-white

#### 10.3.6.4 Inrush and Sequencing

- Some displays need power-up/down in specific order; follow datasheet
