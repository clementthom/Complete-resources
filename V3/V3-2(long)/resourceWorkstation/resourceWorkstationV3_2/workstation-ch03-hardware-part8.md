## 3.93 Introduction: Why Testing and QA Matter

A workstation can have the best design in the world, but if it isn’t tested thoroughly, it will fail in the field.  
Testing and quality assurance (QA) ensure that your build is safe, reliable, and ready for real-world use.  
This chapter walks you, step-by-step, through every aspect of testing and maintenance, from first power-on to long-term service.

## 3.96 Power-On Tests: What to Look For

### 3.96.1 First Power-Up

- Use a current-limited power supply if possible.
- Watch for LEDs lighting up, display backlight, fans spinning.
- Listen and smell: Any crackling, smoke, or odd smells? Power off immediately!

### 3.96.2 Voltage Checks

- Measure all major rails (5V, 12V, -12V, 3.3V) at test points with a multimeter.
- Check for unexpected voltage drops or rails not present.

### 3.96.3 Current Draw

- Compare startup and idle current to your design estimates.
- Large spikes may indicate a short or component fault.

---

## 3.97 Basic Electrical Safety Checks

- Confirm the chassis is properly grounded.
