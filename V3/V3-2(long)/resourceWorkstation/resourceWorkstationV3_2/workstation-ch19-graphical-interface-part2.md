## 19.7 Advanced UI/UX Patterns for Embedded Audio

### 19.7.1 Context Menus, Pop-Ups, and Modal Dialogs

- **Context Menus:** Right-click or long-press actions; show relevant commands for selected item (copy, assign, delete, etc.).
- **Pop-Ups:** Temporary overlays for parameter selection, notifications, or detailed info.
- **Modal Dialogs:** Block further input until user responds (e.g., “Are you sure?”, file dialogs); use sparingly to avoid frustrating flow.
- **Touch/Hardware Support:** Touch-and-hold or dedicated button for context; confirmation via “soft” buttons or pad.

### 19.7.2 Tabs, Accordion Panels, and Multi-View Navigation

- **Tabs:** Switch between different sections (e.g., Oscillator, Filter, FX, Sequencer) with minimal screen real estate.
- **Accordion Panels:** Expand/collapse sections to show/hide advanced settings.
- **Multi-View:** Horizontal/vertical split screens, detachable panels, or swipe navigation for deep editing.
- **Visual Cues:** Highlight tab/panel in focus, animate transitions for clarity.

### 19.7.3 Dynamic Layouts and Responsive Scaling

- **Responsive UI:** Adjusts to screen size, orientation, and resolution; critical for multi-platform (desktop, tablet, embedded LCD).
- **Dynamic Layouts:** Rearrangement of controls when switching from 16-step to 64-step grid, or when displaying more/less info.
- **Constraint Layouts:** Use rules (e.g., “knob always below label”) for automatic reflow.
- **Minimum Touch Target:** Ensure all controls are touchable on smallest allowed display.

### 19.7.4 Shortcut Bars, Quick Access, and Macro Widgets

- **Shortcut Bar:** User-assignable row of favorite actions (copy, paste, quantize, mute).
- **Quick Access Panels:** Pop-up or slide-in for recently used or contextually relevant controls.
- **Macro Widgets:** Group multiple controls under one “macro” (e.g., “Lo-Fi” macro adjusts filter, bitcrush, and FX together).
- **Assignable Pads/Buttons:** Map to any UI function, not just notes/triggers.

### 19.7.5 Undo/Redo, History, and User Confirmation Patterns

- **Undo/Redo Stack:** Multi-level, supports undoing any UI action (edit, move, assign, macro).
- **Visual History:** Timeline or breadcrumb trail of edits.
- **Confirmation Patterns:** Only ask for “Are you sure?” on destructive actions; provide “undo” for less intrusive workflow.
- **Auto-Save and Recovery:** Background save of UI state for crash/power loss recovery.

### 19.7.6 Animated Transitions, Feedback, and Non-Blocking Alerts

- **Animated Transitions:** Smooth movement between screens/panels for orientation.
- **Feedback:** Button press flashes, knob/slider movement echoes on screen, live value pop-ups.
- **Non-Blocking Alerts:** Toaster notifications (bottom/top of screen) for status, errors, tips; disappear automatically or on tap.
- **Vibration/Haptic:** Optional feedback for touch/encoder actions (if hardware supports).

## 19.12 UI Testing, Troubleshooting, and QA

### 19.12.1 Automated UI Testing: Emulators, Scripts, and Regression

- **Emulators:** Simulate UI on PC or CI server; run scripted UI actions.
- **Test Scripts:** Simulate button presses, knob turns, touch gestures; verify UI state and redraws.
- **Regression Testing:** Compare screenshots/hashes to detect unexpected changes.

### 19.12.2 Manual Testing: Checklists, Exploratory, Accessibility

- **Checklists:** Systematic list of UI areas, widgets, and flows to check.
- **Exploratory Testing:** Unscripted use to find edge cases, bugs, or workflow blockers.

## 19.13 Real-World UI Code Patterns and Embedded Examples

### 19.13.1 Widget Architecture and Event Handling (C, C++, Python)

#### 19.13.1.1 Basic Widget Class (C++-like Pseudocode)

```cpp
class Widget {
public:
    int x, y, w, h;
    virtual void draw();
    virtual void handleEvent(Event e);
    virtual void focus();
    // ...state, parent, children
};
class Knob : public Widget { ... };
class Slider : public Widget { ... };
```

#### 19.13.1.2 Event Dispatch

```c
void dispatch_event(Widget* root, Event* e) {
    if (root->contains(e->x, e->y)) {
        root->handleEvent(e);
        for (Widget* child : root->children) dispatch_event(child, e);
    }
}
```

### 19.13.2 Framebuffer Drawing and Partial Redraw Optimizations

- **Framebuffer:** Draw all UI elements to memory, then push to display.
- **Dirty Rectangles:** Track changed regions; only redraw those to save CPU/battery.
- **Double Buffering:** Swap buffers for no-flicker updates, especially on slow displays.

### 19.13.3 Touch and Encoder Input Event Processing

- **Touch Event:** Map coordinates to widget; handle tap, drag, hold, gesture.
- **Encoder Event:** Map encoder to focused widget or parameter; support acceleration/fine adjust.
- **Debounce:** Ignore spurious/fast repeated events.

### 19.13.4 UI Layout Engines, Grids, and Constraint Solvers

- **Grid Layout:** Rows/columns for uniform or weighted widget positioning.
- **Constraint Solver:** Define relationships (“right of”, “below”, “same width”); auto-layout engine solves.
- **Anchors:** Fix widget positions to screen edges or other widgets for responsive UI.

### 19.13.5 Asset Management: Fonts, Bitmaps, and Dynamic Resources

- **Font Loader:** Load/unload fonts at runtime; support for custom and Unicode fonts.
- **Bitmap Cache:** Store pre-rendered icons/images for fast redraw.
- **Resource Manager:** Handles loading, reference counting, freeing of UI assets; avoids memory leaks.

- **Minimize modal dialogs:** Only block input when essential.
- **Make everything undoable:** User confidence, creative exploration.
- **Test in real environments:** Stage, studio, different lighting and touch conditions.
- **Use color and animation sparingly:** Highlight, not distract.
- **Support all users:** Accessibility, customization, localization, user profiles.
- **Document user workflows:** Include quick-start guides and tooltips.
