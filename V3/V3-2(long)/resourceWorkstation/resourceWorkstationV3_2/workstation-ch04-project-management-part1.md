## 4.1 Introduction: Why Project Management Matters

Building a workstation is a large, multi-disciplinary project.  
Without good project management, even the most brilliant technical ideas can fail due to missed deadlines, lost files, unclear goals, or poor communication.  
This chapter is a **beginner-friendly, step-by-step, and exhaustive guide** to all aspects of project management, tailored for large DIY/embedded audio projects.

---

## 4.2 What Is Project Management? (Beginner Orientation)

**Definition:**  
Project management is the practice of organizing, planning, and guiding a project from start to finish.

### 4.2.1 Key Concepts

- **Scope:** What you want to accomplish (features, goals, deliverables).
- **Time:** How long it will take; setting schedules and milestones.
- **Cost:** Budget for parts, tools, services, and your time.
- **Quality:** Setting and maintaining standards for the result.
- **Team:** Who is involved (even if it’s just you!).

### 4.2.2 Why Bother for DIY/Makers?

- Prevents “project drift” and unfinished prototypes.
- Makes it easier to share, collaborate, and get help.
- Saves time and money by reducing mistakes and rework.
- Makes the project easier to document, support, and upgrade in the future.

## 4.3 Project Lifecycle: From Idea to Completion

### 4.3.1 Phases of a Project

| Phase         | Description                                 | Common Artifacts                |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Initiation    | Define goals, constraints, requirements     | Project charter, idea list      |
| Planning      | Plan tasks, schedule, resources, risks      | Gantt chart, milestones, BOM    |
| Execution     | Build, code, assemble, test                 | Source files, PCBs, prototypes  |
| Monitoring    | Track progress, adjust as needed            | Issue tracker, logs, reports    |
| Closing       | Deliver, document, maintain or release      | Final docs, demo, backups       |

### 4.3.2 Iterative vs. Waterfall

- **Waterfall:** Each phase done once, in order.  
  (Rarely works for hardware/software DIY—too rigid.)
- **Iterative/Agile:** Phases repeated as needed, project evolves.  
  (Recommended for workstation projects.)

### 4.3.3 Example: Iterative Hardware/Software Loop

```plaintext
[Plan V1] -> [Build V1] -> [Test V1] -> [Plan V2] -> [Build V2] -> [Test V2] -> ...
```

## 4.4 Planning Your Workstation Project: Key Steps

### 4.4.1 Define Goals

- What will your workstation DO?
- Who will use it? (Just you? Others? Public?)
- What are the “must-have” vs. “nice-to-have” features?

### 4.4.2 Research and Inspiration

- Study classic workstations (see Chapter 1).
- Make a “wishlist” of features from other gear/software.
- Read forums, blogs, and watch demos for ideas.

### 4.4.3 Constraints

- Budget: How much can you spend?
- Timeline: Do you have a deadline?
- Skill: What do you need to learn before starting?
- Parts/tools: What do you already have?

### 4.4.4 Write a Simple Project Charter

**Example:**
- **Goal:** Build a portable workstation with sampling, synthesis, and sequencing.
- **Features:** 8-track sequencer, touch UI, MIDI/CV, SD storage, USB.
- **Deadline:** Demo at local synth meet in 12 months.
- **Budget:** €800 for parts/tools.

### 4.4.5 Break Down Into Tasks

- Use a “Work Breakdown Structure” (WBS):
    - Hardware: Design, order, assemble, test
    - Software: UI, sequencer, synth engine, I/O
    - Documentation: Schematics, user manual, code docs
    - Testing: Unit, integration, usability

### 4.4.6 Estimate Time and Resources

- Guess how long each task will take (add extra time for learning and surprises!).
- Identify dependencies (can’t write DSP code until audio I/O works).

|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Repository    | The folder where all your project files live |
| Commit        | A snapshot of your files at a point in time  |
| Branch        | A parallel line of development (e.g., for a feature or bugfix) |
| Merge         | Combine changes from two branches            |
| Remote        | Copy of repo on GitHub, GitLab, or other server |
| Pull Request  | Propose changes to be merged into main repo  |

### 4.6.4 Setting Up Git (Beginner Steps)

1. **Install Git:**  
   - On Linux: `sudo apt install git`  
   - On Mac: `brew install git`  
   - On Windows: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

2. **Configure Your Info:**  
   - `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
   - `git config --global user.email "you@email.com"`

3. **Start a New Repo:**  
   ```bash
   git init <your-project-folder>
   cd <your-project-folder>
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. **Create a GitHub Repo:**  
   - Go to GitHub, click “New repository”.
   - Name it, add description, create.
   - Follow GitHub’s instructions to “push” your local repo.

5. **Clone an Existing Repo:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
   cd repo
   ```

6. **Basic Workflow:**  
   - Make changes
   - `git add .`
   - `git commit -m "Describe your changes"`
   - `git push` (to GitHub)

### 4.6.5 GitHub Workflow for Beginners

- Use “main” branch for stable code.
- Create new branches for features or fixes (`git checkout -b feature-x`).
- Open Pull Requests on GitHub to propose merges.
- Use Issues to track bugs, ideas, or tasks.

---

## 4.7 Issue Tracking, Milestones, and Kanban Boards

### 4.7.1 Issues

- Each “issue” is a to-do, bug, idea, or request.
- On GitHub, click “Issues” tab, then “New Issue”.
- Use labels (bug, enhancement, documentation) for organization.

### 4.7.2 Milestones

- Group related issues into “milestones” (e.g., v1.0 release).
- Track progress as issues are closed.

### 4.7.3 Kanban Boards

- Visual tool to manage workflow.
- Columns: To Do, Doing, Done (can customize).
- Move issues/cards between columns as work progresses.
- GitHub Projects offers built-in Kanban boards.

### 4.7.4 Example Kanban Flow

```plaintext
[To Do] --> [In Progress] --> [Testing] --> [Done]
```

- Drag and drop issues/cards as you work.

| Schedule     | Delays, conflicting priorities                  |
| Budget       | Costs run over, shipping fees, customs          |
| Team         | Sickness, team member leaves, burnout           |
| Quality      | Noise issues, firmware bugs, user confusion     |

### 4.11.3 Mitigation Strategies

- Always have a backup part or vendor.
- Build/test in small increments to catch problems early.
- Set realistic milestones with slack time.
- Document everything, so others can help if you’re unavailable.

### 4.11.4 Example: Hardware Part Shortage

- Identify: “Critical DAC chip is out of stock.”
- Mitigate: Research compatible alternatives, order spares early, design socketed boards.
