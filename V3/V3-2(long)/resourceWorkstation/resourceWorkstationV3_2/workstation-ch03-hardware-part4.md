## 3.35 What is MIDI? (History, Protocol, Use)

**MIDI** is a standard protocol invented in 1983 to let synths, drum machines, computers, and other gear talk to each other.  
It is a **digital language** for music, sending notes, controls, clock, and more—not audio.

### 3.35.1 Key MIDI Concepts

- **Messages, not Sound:** MIDI tells an instrument "play C4 at velocity 90", not the actual sound.
- **Channels:** 16 per cable; each instrument listens to its own channel.
- **Note On/Off:** The most basic messages—start and stop a note.
- **Velocity:** How hard you hit a key.
- **Control Change (CC):** For knobs, faders, pedals (e.g., CC1 is mod wheel).
- **Pitch Bend:** Smooth pitch changes.
- **Program Change:** Load different sounds/patches.
- **Clock:** Keeps drum machines and sequencers in sync.

### 3.35.2 MIDI in Modern Workstations

- **Live:** Play keys/pads, sync with drum machines, automate parameters.
- **Studio:** Record MIDI into a DAW, edit performances, send to outboard synths.
- **Modular:** MIDI-to-CV converts MIDI to analog voltages for modular synths.

---

## 3.36 MIDI Hardware: DIN, USB, BLE, and More

### 3.36.1 MIDI DIN (The Classic 5-Pin Plug)

- **DIN-5:** The original round connector for MIDI In, Out, Thru.
- **Voltage:** 5V logic, current loop—robust, noise-resistant.

### 3.36.2 USB MIDI

- **Modern Standard:** Almost all controllers and synths today.
- **Plug-and-play:** No drivers needed with Linux/Pi.
- **Multiple Devices:** Supports hubs, many devices at once.

### 3.36.3 BLE MIDI

- **Bluetooth Low Energy:** Wireless, for iPads, phones, modern synths.
- **Range:** 10–30 meters, depends on environment.
- **Latency:** Slightly higher than wired, but improving.

### 3.36.4 Other MIDI Hardware

- **TRS MIDI:** 3.5mm jack, same messages as DIN. Not all gear pins are wired the same—watch out!
- **Optical MIDI:** Fiber optic for long runs (rare in DIY).
- **Network MIDI:** Over Ethernet/WiFi (via rtpMIDI, OSC).

## 3.37 How to Wire and Use Classic MIDI DIN Ports

### 3.37.1 The 5-Pin DIN Pinout

```plaintext
    (Facing socket on instrument)
       .  2  .
     4       5
       .  3  .
```
| Pin | Name | Use         |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 2   | GND  | Shield      |
| 4   | Out  | Data (+5V)  |
| 5   | In   | Data (Signal)|
| 1,3 | NC   | Not used    |

### 3.37.2 Building a MIDI In Circuit (Opto-Isolated)

**Why opto-isolation?**  
To prevent ground loops and protect from voltage differences between gear.

**Basic Parts Needed:**
- 5-pin DIN socket
- Opto-isolator IC (6N138 is standard, H11L1 for faster response)
- Resistors: 220Ω, 1kΩ, 10kΩ
- Small signal diode (1N4148)
- Capacitor (0.1uF)

**Wiring Steps:**
1. MIDI In socket pin 4 → 220Ω resistor → anode of opto LED.
2. Pin 5 → cathode of opto LED (via 1N4148 diode).
3. Opto output connects to Pi GPIO via 10k pull-up resistor.
4. Pin 2 (GND) connects to shield, but **not** to Pi ground.

**Note:**  
Never connect MIDI input ground to your main circuit ground directly; that's what the opto-isolator is for.

### 3.37.3 Building MIDI Out Circuit

- Simple: Pi GPIO sends data via 220Ω resistor to DIN pin 5; pin 4 to +5V via 220Ω.
- Always buffer output with a transistor or logic chip (74LS04) for safety.
- MIDI Out ground (pin 2) can connect to Pi ground.

### 3.37.4 MIDI Thru Port

- Copies MIDI In to another device.
- Use a buffer IC (74HC14) for proper signal shaping.
- In practice, many DIY builds skip Thru unless chaining lots of devices.

## 3.38 USB MIDI: Controllers, Hosts, and Compatibility

### 3.38.1 What is USB MIDI?

- USB MIDI is a class-compliant protocol; most controllers and synths “just work” on Linux/Pi/Solus.
- You can use keyboards, pad controllers, control surfaces, and even some audio interfaces.

### 3.38.2 USB Host vs. Device

- **Host:** Your Pi acts as the “computer”—other devices (controllers) plug in.
- **Device:** Your Pi can appear as a MIDI instrument to a PC/DAW (needs gadget drivers or MIDI USB gadget mode).

### 3.38.3 Connecting USB MIDI Devices

1. Plug your controller into any Pi USB port.
2. Type `lsusb` to see if it’s detected.
3. ALSA tools (`aconnect`, `amidi`, `aseqdump`) can show available MIDI ports.
4. Most modern Linux software will list these as “MIDI Input” or “MIDI Output” devices.

### 3.38.4 Using Hubs

- You can connect multiple controllers using a powered USB hub.
- Watch total current—Raspberry Pi can safely power about 1A total from its USB ports.

### 3.38.5 Troubleshooting USB MIDI

- **Not detected:** Try a powered hub, or a different cable.
- **No events:** Check with `aseqdump` or a MIDI monitor app.
- **Jitter/lag:** Disconnect unused devices, avoid long chains.

## 3.39 BLE MIDI: Wireless MIDI for Modern Setups

### 3.39.1 What is BLE MIDI?

- BLE MIDI uses Bluetooth Low Energy to send MIDI data wirelessly.
- Supported by iOS, Mac, Windows (with apps), and some modern synths.

### 3.39.2 Using BLE MIDI on Raspberry Pi

1. Make sure your Pi has Bluetooth (Pi 3/4/5 or USB dongle).
2. Install `bluez` and `bluez-alsa`/`bluez-utils`.
3. Pair your BLE MIDI device in the Pi’s desktop or with `bluetoothctl`.
4. Use `aconnect` to route BLE MIDI to your software.

### 3.39.3 Tips for BLE MIDI

- **Range:** Up to 10–30 meters line-of-sight; less through walls.
- **Latency:** Usually under 10ms, but can spike if there’s interference.
- **Power:** BLE is low-power; good for battery-powered controllers.

### 3.39.4 Troubleshooting BLE MIDI

- **Pairing fails:** Power-cycle both devices and try again.
- **Laggy/unstable:** Move closer, reduce other Bluetooth devices.
- **Not showing up:** Make sure your Pi's Bluetooth is enabled and `bluez` is running.

## 3.40 MIDI Thru, Merge, and Splitter Circuits

### 3.40.1 MIDI Thru

- Passes MIDI In directly to one or more other devices.
- Use a buffer IC for signal integrity.
- Daisy-chaining too many devices can cause timing errors.

### 3.40.2 MIDI Merge

- Combines two or more MIDI streams.
- Requires a microcontroller (Arduino, Teensy, Pi Pico) to merge incoming bytes correctly—can't just wire them together!
- For most users, a single MIDI In is enough; use merge for complex rigs.

### 3.40.3 MIDI Splitter

- Sends one MIDI Out to multiple devices.
- Use buffer chips or commercial splitters for best results.

### 3.40.4 Basic Splitter Schematic

```plaintext
[MIDI Out]---[74HC14 buffer]---[DIN socket 1]
                           |---[DIN socket 2]
                           |---[DIN socket 3]
```

## 3.41 Understanding Control Voltage (CV) & Gate

### 3.41.1 What is CV?

- **Control Voltage (CV):** An analog voltage (often 0–5V or 0–10V, sometimes bipolar ±5V) used to control parameters (pitch, filter, modulation) in analog synths, modular gear, and some digital devices.

### 3.41.2 What is a Gate/Trigger?

- **Gate:** A voltage that goes high (e.g., 5V) when a note is on, low (0V) when off. Used for envelopes, note on/off.
- **Trigger:** A short pulse, used to start events (e.g., drum hits).

### 3.41.3 CV Standards

| System       | Pitch CV         | Gate             | Notes                      |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Eurorack     | 1V/oct (0–10V)   | +5V, 0/5V        | Most common                |
| Moog         | 1V/oct (0–10V)   | S-Trig (short to GND) | Legacy, beware!           |
| Buchla       | 1.2V/oct (0–10V) | +10V             | Rare in DIY                |

### 3.41.4 CV in a Workstation

- **Input:** Bring in analog control from modulars, pedals, sensors.
- **Output:** Send LFOs, envelopes, sequencer steps to control external gear.

## 3.42 CV Input and Output: Circuits, Protection, Scaling

### 3.42.1 CV Input Circuit

**Goal:** Read an analog voltage safely into your Pi or microcontroller.

**Parts Needed:**
- Op-amp buffer (TL072, OPA2134)
- Voltage divider resistors (e.g., 100k/100k for 0–10V to 0–5V)
- Protection diodes (1N4148)
- Series resistor (10k)
- Optional TVS diode for ESD

**Wiring Steps:**
1. CV input jack → series resistor → non-inverting input of op-amp.
2. Output of op-amp → voltage divider → Pi ADC (via external ADC chip).
3. Clamp diodes from ADC input to 3.3V and GND for overvoltage protection.

**Tip:**  
Never connect a high voltage (>3.3V) directly to a Pi GPIO pin; always buffer and scale!

### 3.42.2 CV Output Circuit

**Goal:** Output a programmable voltage (0–5V, ±5V, etc.) to modulars or analog synths.

**Parts Needed:**
- External DAC (e.g., MCP4922, PCM5102)
- Op-amp buffer (rail-to-rail output)
- Precision reference voltage (for accurate scaling)
- Optional trimpot for fine adjustment

**Steps:**
1. Pi sends SPI/I2C data to DAC.
2. DAC output → op-amp buffer → output jack.
3. Use trimpot to calibrate exact 1V/oct scaling.

### 3.42.3 Calibration

- Use a voltmeter and reference module (e.g., a tuner or modular oscillator).
- Output known values (1V, 2V, etc.), adjust trimpot or software offset until pitch tracks perfectly.

## 3.43 Gate/Trigger Input and Output: Basics, Circuits

### 3.43.1 Gate Input

- Use a series resistor (10k) and clamp diodes to Pi GPIO.
- For high voltages, use a voltage divider or opto-isolator.
- Schmitt trigger buffer (e.g., 74HC14) cleans up slow edges.

### 3.43.2 Gate Output

- Use a Pi GPIO pin via a small NPN transistor or MOSFET to switch 5V to the output jack.
- Add a pull-down resistor (10k) on the output.

### 3.43.3 Compatibility Notes

- Some systems (Moog) use S-Trig (short to ground) instead of V-Trig (voltage high).
- Add a switch or jumper to select mode if needed.

## 3.44 Analog Sync: Clock, DIN Sync, and Modular Integration

### 3.44.1 Analog Clock

- A pulse (e.g., 5V) sent at each beat or step, used to sync sequencers and drum machines.
- Can be input (follow external clock) or output (send master clock).

### 3.44.2 DIN Sync

- Used by older Roland gear.
- 5-pin DIN connector, sends 24 pulses per quarter note (ppqn) and a start/stop signal.

### 3.44.3 Modular Integration

- Use clock divider/multiplier circuits (e.g., CD4017, 555 timer) for advanced sync options.
- Always buffer clock signals with a Schmitt trigger or transistor.

## 3.45 Advanced External Control: Footswitches, Expression, Sensors

### 3.45.1 Footswitches

- Simple on/off pedal.
- Connect to GPIO (with pull-down), or use standard 1/4” jack.
- Can control sustain, start/stop, patch change, etc.

### 3.45.2 Expression Pedals

- Variable resistor (potentiometer), usually 10k–100k.
- Forms voltage divider with 3.3V (or 5V) supply, wiper to ADC input.
- Scale value in software to desired effect (volume, wah, etc.).

### 3.45.3 Other Sensors

- Light sensors, accelerometers, breath controllers—all can connect to analog or digital inputs.
- Use ADCs, I2C/SPI, or USB (for digital sensors).

---

## 3.46 Debugging, Testing, and Best Practices

### 3.46.1 Testing MIDI I/O

- Use `amidi`, `aseqdump`, or MIDI monitor software to see if events are being received/sent.
- Plug a known working controller into each input, verify all channels and CCs work.
- For DIY circuits, check for correct voltages, no shorts, and proper signal polarity.

### 3.46.2 Testing CV/Gate

- Use a voltmeter to check CV output matches expected values.
- Connect to an external synth or modular—verify pitch and gate tracking.
- For inputs, send known voltages and verify correct ADC readings.
- Use an oscilloscope to check for clean, sharp gate/trigger pulses.

### 3.46.3 Best Practices

- Always use opto-isolators for MIDI In.
- Never connect external voltages to Pi GPIOs without buffering/protection.
- Label all jacks, especially if there are many similar ones!
