## 12.1 Introduction: Why Protocols Matter in Workstations

Protocols—MIDI, CV/Gate, OSC, USB, and others—are the “language” that lets a workstation communicate with synths, DAWs, controllers, and effects.  
Understanding these protocols is essential for:
- Building hardware that “just works” with the outside world
- Ensuring tight timing, low latency, and reliable control
- Supporting advanced control (automation, modulation, expressive play)

This chapter is a detailed, beginner-friendly, and exhaustive guide to classic and modern MIDI, hardware design, and major extensions.

## 12.2 Classic MIDI: History, Hardware, and Electrical

### 12.2.1 What is MIDI? Overview and History

- **MIDI = Musical Instrument Digital Interface**
- Created in early 1980s by Roland, Sequential, Yamaha, and others
- Standardized in 1983; revolutionized music gear interoperability
- Originally designed for keyboard synths, now used everywhere: DAWs, lighting, control surfaces, effects

**Key Features:**
- Serial protocol (31,250 bits/sec, 8N1)
- 16 channels per port (multi-instrument)
- Compact, simple, robust
- Supports note, controller, program changes, pitch bend, aftertouch, sync, and more

### 12.2.2 MIDI Hardware: 5-Pin DIN, TRS, USB

#### 12.2.2.1 5-Pin DIN

- Original, still most common in hardware synths and workstations
- 5-pin circular connector; only pins 2 (GND), 4 (TX), 5 (RX) used

#### 12.2.2.2 TRS MIDI (Type A/B)

- 3.5mm stereo jack for compact gear (Arturia, Novation, Korg, etc.)
- Two “standards”: Type A (MIDI Association, Korg), Type B (Novation, Arturia)
- Adapters available, but confusing—always check gear compatibility

#### 12.2.2.3 USB MIDI

- For computers, modern controllers, some synths
- Uses USB class-compliant devices (no driver needed on Mac, Windows, Linux)
- Supports multiple “virtual cables” (ports) and higher speeds

### 12.2.3 MIDI Electrical: Current Loop, Optoisolation, Pinout

#### 12.2.3.1 Current Loop

- MIDI uses a 5mA current loop (not voltage logic), robust against noise
- Prevents ground loops and interference

#### 12.2.3.2 Optoisolation

- MIDI In must be opto-isolated (no direct ground connection)
- Ensures safety and avoids ground loops between gear

#### 12.2.3.3 Pinout (5-Pin DIN)

| Pin | Function     | Notes                          |
|-----|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 1   | Not used     | Sometimes 3.3V (rare)         |
| 2   | GND          | Shield, not signal ground      |
| 3   | Not used     | Sometimes 3.3V (rare)         |
| 4   | Data (TX)    | Via 220Ω resistor             |
| 5   | Data (RX)    | Via 220Ω resistor             |

#### 12.2.3.4 Cable Wiring

- Pin 4 and 5: twisted pair (data)
- Pin 2: shield

#### 12.2.3.5 Max Cable Length

- MIDI standard: 15 meters (50 feet) max for reliable transmission

### 12.2.4 MIDI Signal Path: In, Out, Thru, Merge, Split

#### 12.2.4.1 MIDI In

- Receives MIDI data, always opto-isolated

#### 12.2.4.2 MIDI Out

- Sends MIDI data generated by device

#### 12.2.4.3 MIDI Thru

- Passes incoming MIDI In data directly to another device (hardware “buffer,” not software)
- Used for daisy-chaining devices

#### 12.2.4.4 Merge & Split

- **Merge:** Combine data from two or more sources into one stream (requires active electronics, not passive)
- **Split:** Distribute one MIDI Out to multiple Ins (use a MIDI Thru box or active splitter)

### 12.2.5 MIDI Cables, Adapters, and Length Limits

- Use proper 5-pin DIN or shielded TRS cables for full signal integrity
- Avoid using 5-pin DIN audio cables (not all pins wired correctly)
- Cable length: up to 15m (50ft) per MIDI spec, but keep shorter if possible for best timing
- Adapters: Carefully match TRS type (A/B), use manufacturer’s adapters if possible

## 12.3 MIDI Message Structure: Channel, System, and Real-Time

### 12.3.1 MIDI Message Byte Structure: Status, Data1, Data2

- Each message: 1 status byte (MSB=1) + 1 or 2 data bytes (MSB=0)
- Status: 0x8n–0xEn (channel), 0xF0–0xFF (system)
- Data1: note number, controller number, program, etc.
- Data2: velocity, value, etc.

#### 12.3.1.1 Example: Note On

- Status: 0x9n (n=channel 0–15)
- Data1: Note number (0–127)
- Data2: Velocity (0–127)

#### 12.3.1.2 Running Status

- Status byte omitted if same as previous message (saves bandwidth)

### 12.3.2 Channel Voice Messages (Note, CC, PC, AT, PB)

| Status (Hex) | Message           | Data1         | Data2       | Description                |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| 0x8n         | Note Off          | Note #        | Velocity    | Release note               |
| 0x9n         | Note On           | Note #        | Velocity    | Play note (vel=0 = off)    |
| 0xAn         | Poly AT           | Note #        | Pressure    | Per-note aftertouch        |
| 0xBn         | Control Change    | Controller #  | Value       | Knobs, pedals, etc.        |
| 0xCn         | Program Change    | Program #     |             | Change patch/preset        |
| 0xDn         | Channel AT        | Pressure      |             | Channel aftertouch         |
| 0xEn         | Pitch Bend        | LSB           | MSB         | 14-bit (0x2000 = center)   |

### 12.3.3 System Common, System Real-Time, and Exclusive (SysEx)

#### 12.3.3.1 System Common

| Status | Message              | Description                   |

#### 12.3.3.3 System Exclusive (SysEx)

- Start: 0xF0, End: 0xF7
- Manufacturer ID, model ID, data, checksum
- Used for patch dumps, device config, “bulk” parameter transfer

### 12.3.4 Message Timing and Running Status

- Running status: omit status byte if same as previous
- Important for high-speed message streams (notes, CCs)
- Some devices require periodic “active sensing” (0xFE) to verify connection

### 12.3.5 MIDI Channels, Omni, Poly, Mono Modes

- 16 channels per port (0–15)
- **Omni On:** Responds to all channels
- **Poly Mode:** Multiple notes per channel
- **Mono Mode:** Only one note per channel (guitar synths, MPE, some analogs)

## 12.4 MIDI Implementation: Embedded and Software

### 12.4.1 UART/USART Setup for MIDI (31.25kbps, 8N1)

- Set serial port: 31,250 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1)
- Use dedicated UART or bit-banged solution on MCUs
- Opto-isolator on input, 220Ω resistors on output

#### 12.4.1.1 Example: Arduino MIDI Serial Setup

```c
Serial.begin(31250);
// Use Serial.write() for MIDI bytes
```

#### 12.4.1.2 Example: STM32 HAL UART

```c
huart.Instance = USARTx;
huart.Init.BaudRate = 31250;
huart.Init.WordLength = UART_WORDLENGTH_8B;
huart.Init.StopBits = UART_STOPBITS_1;
huart.Init.Parity = UART_PARITY_NONE;
// HAL_UART_Init(&huart);
```

### 12.4.2 Buffering, Parsing, and State Machines

- Use circular/ring buffer for incoming/outgoing MIDI bytes
- Parse incoming data: detect status/data bytes, handle running status
- State machine: keep track of message type, data required, running status

#### 12.4.2.1 Example: MIDI Message Parsing State Machine

```c
enum MIDIState { WAIT_STATUS, WAIT_DATA1, WAIT_DATA2 };
MIDIState state = WAIT_STATUS;
uint8_t status, data1, data2;
```

### 12.4.3 MIDI Libraries for Embedded: Arduino, STM32, Teensy, ESP32

- **Arduino MIDI Library:** Complete, supports input/output, callbacks, filtering
- **Teensy MIDI:** Hardware MIDI, USB-MIDI, high speed, multiple ports
- **STM32/ESP32:** HAL drivers + open-source MIDI libraries (see github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library, github.com/tttapa/MIDI_controller, etc.)

### 12.4.4 MIDI Libraries for Desktop: RtMidi, ALSA, CoreMIDI, JUCE

- **RtMidi:** Cross-platform C++ MIDI I/O (Linux, Mac, Windows)
- **ALSA MIDI:** Linux kernel MIDI subsystem
- **CoreMIDI:** macOS/iOS MIDI API
- **JUCE:** C++ framework for audio/MIDI, used in pro plugins, DAWs

### 12.4.5 MIDI Routing, Filtering, Mapping, and Merging

- **Routing:** Map MIDI In to Out, merge multiple inputs, split by channel
- **Filtering:** Block certain channels, message types, or note ranges
- **Mapping:** Remap CCs, notes, or programs for custom control layouts
- **Merging:** Combine real-time input with sequencer/automation data

### 12.4.6 MIDI Diagnostics and Troubleshooting

- Use MIDI monitor tools (MIDI-OX, MIDITools, DAW monitor)
- Hardware testers: LED blinkers, logic analyzers, serial sniffers
- Common issues: stuck notes (missing Note Off), cable/adaptor mixups, ground loops, opto isolation failure, baud rate mismatch

## 12.5 Modern MIDI: USB, BLE, MPE, and MIDI 2.0

### 12.5.1 USB-MIDI: Class Compliant, Descriptors, Endpoints

- **USB-MIDI Class (1.0):** No driver needed, “plug and play” on Mac/Win/Linux
- Descriptors: Device tells host it is a MIDI class device (report endpoints, cables)
- Multiple “virtual cables” supported
- MIDI 1.0 packets: 4 bytes (cable, code index, 2 data bytes)

#### 12.5.1.1 USB-MIDI Firmware Example

- Arduino/Teensy: Use USB-MIDI firmware profile
- STM32: Use CubeMX USB middleware, select “Audio/MIDI Device Class”

### 12.5.2 BLE-MIDI: Bluetooth LE, Latency, Pairing, and Security

- MIDI over BLE: Low-energy wireless MIDI for mobile/tablet/portable gear
- Lower latency than classic Bluetooth, but still higher than wired
- Pairing: Advertise as BLE MIDI device, pair with host, exchange MIDI packets
- Security: BLE security layers, but not always enabled by default

### 12.5.3 MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression): Zones, Per-Note Controllers

- Each note on separate “zone” (MIDI channel), allows independent pitch bend, aftertouch, CC per note
- ROLI Seaboard, LinnStrument, Haken Continuum
- Requires MPE-aware hardware/software for full support

#### 12.5.3.1 MPE Message Structure

- Master channel: global controls
- Member channels: each note, per-note CC, pitch bend, aftertouch

### 12.5.4 MIDI 2.0: Protocol, Profiles, Property Exchange, CI

- **MIDI 2.0 (2020):** Major update, backward-compatible, expanded resolution, new message types
- 32-bit data path, high-res velocity, per-note articulation, profiles (synth, organ, drum, etc.)
- Property exchange: Devices communicate capabilities, patch names, icons, etc.
- **CI (Capability Inquiry):** Devices discover what each supports

#### 12.5.4.1 MIDI 2.0 UMP (Universal MIDI Packet)

- 32-bit words, much higher data rate, more flexible
- Few devices support it yet (as of 2025), but adoption growing

### 12.5.5 MIDI over RTP, Ethernet, and Wireless

- RTP-MIDI: MIDI over network (used in Apple macOS, iOS, iPad, Windows)
- Pros: Long-distance, multi-port, low-latency on LAN
- Cons: Needs setup, not supported on all hardware
- Wireless: WiFi, Bluetooth, proprietary radio for remote control
