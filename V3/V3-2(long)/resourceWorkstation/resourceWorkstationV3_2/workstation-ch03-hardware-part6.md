## 3.61 Introduction to Power Management

Power management is one of the most critical—and often overlooked—elements in building a reliable workstation.  
If you get it wrong, you’ll face noise, crashes, fried components, and even safety hazards.  
This section is written for **complete beginners** and walks through every aspect of power in detail.

---

## 3.62 Why Power Design Matters in Audio Workstations

- **Noise and Hum:** Poor power design injects noise into analog audio, resulting in hum, buzz, and hiss.
- **Reliability:** Power issues are the #1 cause of mysterious crashes and data loss.
- **Safety:** Incorrect wiring can create fire, electric shock, or damage expensive gear.
- **Expandability:** Good power design allows you to add new modules, shields, or peripherals with confidence.

---

## 3.63 Power Supply Basics: Voltages, Currents, and Safety

### 3.63.1 Voltage

- **Voltage (V):** The electrical “pressure” that pushes current.
- Your Pi and digital logic usually need **+5V** or **+3.3V**.
- Analog audio may need **±12V** (dual-rail), sometimes only +12V or +15V.

### 3.63.2 Current

- **Current (A or mA):** The flow of electricity.
- Add up all device draws to determine the *minimum* supply current.

### 3.63.3 Power

- **Power (W):** Voltage x Current.
- Example: 5V at 2A = 10W.

### 3.63.4 Safety

- Always use supplies with proper insulation and certifications (CE, UL, etc.).
- Never touch exposed mains wiring!
- For beginners, always use prebuilt adapters, not open-frame supplies.

## 3.64 Choosing a Power Supply for Your Workstation

### 3.64.1 Calculate Your Needs

| Device          | Voltage | Current (typ) | Notes                          |
|-----------------|---------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi 4  | 5V      | 0.6–3A        | Peaks with USB, HDMI           |
| Audio DAC/Opamps| ±12V    | 50–200mA      | Depends on analog design       |
| LEDs/Displays   | 5V      | 100–500mA     | RGB LEDs can be power-hungry   |
| USB Devices     | 5V      | 500mA+ each   | Multiply by # of devices       |
| Speakers/Amps   | 5–12V   | 500mA–2A      | Only if using onboard speakers |

- Add 20–30% overhead for future expansion and startup surges.

### 3.64.2 Power Supply Types

- **Wall Adapter ("Wall Wart"):** Most common, easy, safe.
- **Open-Frame/Bench Supply:** For advanced users and prototyping.
- **Battery Pack:** For portable builds; must be matched to current/voltage needs.

### 3.64.3 Plug Types

- Use locking DC barrel jacks for reliability.
- Mark polarity (*center positive* is standard, but always check!).

---

## 3.65 AC-DC Adapters, Linear vs. Switching Supplies

### 3.65.1 Linear Power Supplies

- **Pros:** Ultra-low noise, great for analog.
- **Cons:** Heavy, inefficient, get hot, expensive at higher power.

### 3.65.2 Switching Power Supplies (SMPS)

- **Pros:** Efficient, small, cheap, can supply high power.
- **Cons:** Can inject high-frequency noise into audio if not well-filtered.

### 3.65.3 Which to Use?

- For beginners, **high-quality switchers** (Meanwell, CUI) are fine for Pi and logic.
- For *critical analog*, consider a linear regulator after the switcher for ultra-quiet rails.

### 3.65.4 Filtering Noise

- Add ferrite beads, LC filters, and extra capacitance at power entry.
- Use local decoupling caps near every IC.

---

## 3.66 Internal Power Regulation: Linear and Switching Regulators, LDOs

### 3.66.1 Linear Regulators (e.g., 7805, LM317, LDOs)

- **Drop voltage** down to needed level, dissipate excess as heat.
- **LDO (Low Dropout):** Can regulate even with small voltage difference.

### 3.66.2 Switching Regulators (Buck/Boost)

- **Buck:** Steps voltage down (e.g., 12V to 5V).
- **Boost:** Steps voltage up (e.g., 5V to 12V).
- **Buck-Boost:** Can do both, useful for battery operation.

### 3.66.3 Choosing Regulators

- Use **linear** for analog audio (low noise).
- Use **switching** for digital loads and battery efficiency.

### 3.66.4 Example Power Tree

```plaintext
[12V In]
   |
+--+-------+
|          |
[7805]   [LM7812/7912]
|         |      |
5V Logic  +12V  -12V Analog
```

## 3.67 Power Rail Separation: Digital, Analog, and Peripheral Isolation

### 3.67.1 Why Separate Rails?

- Digital circuits (Pi, logic, USB) generate noise that can pollute audio.
- Analog circuits (op-amps, DAC, VCF) need ultra-clean power.

### 3.67.2 How to Separate

- Use **separate regulators** for analog and digital rails.
- Add **ferrite beads or inductors** between rails.
- Keep analog ground and digital ground separate, join at a single point ("star ground").

### 3.67.3 Examples

- **DAC/Op-amps:** Use dedicated 3.3V/5V/12V analog rail.
- **LEDs/Displays:** Power from digital 5V, never analog supply.

---

## 3.68 Grounding Schemes: Star, Plane, Chassis, and Loops

### 3.68.1 Star Ground

- All sub-circuit grounds return to a single point.
- Prevents ground loops and noise.

### 3.68.2 Ground Planes

- Use solid copper plane under analog sections of PCB.
- Digital ground plane under logic.

### 3.68.3 Chassis Ground

- Metal cases should be grounded for safety.
- Only connect chassis ground to circuit ground at a *single* point, ideally power entry.

### 3.68.4 Avoiding Ground Loops

- Never connect grounds in multiple places.
- Watch out for ground through both power AND audio cables.

---

## 3.69 Fuses, Polyfuses, and Overcurrent Protection

### 3.69.1 Fuses

- **Glass fuse:** Blows once, must be replaced.
- **Polyfuse (PTC):** Resets after overload. Good for low-current DC.

### 3.69.2 Where to Use Fuses

- Always fuse main power input.
- Fuse each rail if possible (especially battery lines).

### 3.69.3 Choosing Fuse Ratings

- Slightly above your system's max current draw.
- Example: If max draw is 2A, use 2.5A fuse.

### 3.69.4 Wiring

- Place fuse as close as possible to power entry.

---

## 3.70 Reverse Polarity and Overvoltage Protection

### 3.70.1 Reverse Polarity

- **Diode Bridge:** Protects against plugging supply in backwards.
- **Single Schottky Diode:** Cheap, drops 0.3–0.7V.

### 3.70.2 Overvoltage

- **TVS Diode:** Clamps spikes above rated voltage.
- **MOV (Metal Oxide Varistor):** Protects against surges (less common in DC).

### 3.70.3 Crowbar Circuit

- Uses a thyristor to short supply if voltage goes too high, blowing the fuse.

---

## 3.71 Battery Power: Types, Sizing, and Integration

### 3.71.1 When to Use Batteries

- For portable, busking, or field-use workstations.
- Backup power for safe shutdown during blackouts.

### 3.71.2 Battery Types

| Type      | Pros           | Cons                  | Notes                      |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Li-ion/LiPo| High energy, light| Needs protection circuit| Most common in DIY         |
| NiMH      | Safe, easy     | Heavy, lower capacity | AA/AAA cells, easy to source|
| Lead-Acid | Cheap, robust  | Heavy, low energy     | Only for big, stationary rigs|
| LiFePO4   | Safe, stable   | More expensive        | Longer lifespan            |

### 3.71.3 Sizing Your Battery

- Calculate total power draw (W) × hours of use = required Wh.
- Example: 10W system for 5 hours = 50Wh needed.
- For Li-ion: Wh / battery voltage (e.g., 3.7V) = amp-hours (Ah) needed.

### 3.71.4 Battery Packs

- Use packs with built-in protection (BMS = Battery Management System).
- Never use naked Li-ion/LiPo cells without protection!

### 3.73.1 Hot-Swapping

- Ability to plug/unplug power or modules while running.
- Use power path controller ICs (e.g., LTC4412) to switch between sources safely.

### 3.73.2 Power Path Control

- For battery + external power: automatically switch to adapter when plugged in.
- Prevents back-feeding and brownouts.

### 3.73.3 Power Sequencing

- Some analog ICs require rails to come up in a specific order.
- Use supervisor ICs or RC delay circuits to control power-on sequence.

---

## 3.74 Power Distribution: Bus Bars, Wire Gauges, and Connectors

### 3.74.1 Bus Bars

- For high-current rails (>5A), use thick copper bars or heavy traces.

### 3.74.2 Wire Gauge
