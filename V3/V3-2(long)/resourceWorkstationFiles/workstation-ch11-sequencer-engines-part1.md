## 11.1 Introduction: The Central Role of Sequencers in Workstations

Sequencers are the “brain” of most modern music workstations and grooveboxes.  
A sequencer allows you to record, edit, and play back musical events—notes, controls, automation—on a timeline or a grid.  
Understanding sequencers is essential for both users and developers of workstation systems.

**Sequencers can be:**
- Simple (8-step drum machine)
- Complex (song mode with multiple patterns, automation lanes, live recording)
- Hardware-based (TR-808, MPC, Elektron)
- Software-based (DAW, tracker, plugin, embedded)

A strong grasp of sequencer fundamentals makes it possible to design powerful, flexible, and intuitive music workstations.

## 11.2 Sequencer Types and Models

### 11.2.1 Step Sequencers: Classic and Modern

- Divide time into fixed “steps” (e.g., 16 steps per bar)
- Each step can trigger a note, drum hit, or event
- Classic: Roland TR-808/909 (16-step), x0x clones, Korg Volca, Arturia BeatStep
- Modern: Polyphonic, per-step parameter locks (Elektron), probability, microtiming
- Intuitive, immediate, visually mapped to grid/buttons

#### 11.2.1.1 Example: 16-Step Drum Pattern

| Step: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Kick  | X |   |   |   | X |   |   |   | X |    |    |    | X  |    |    |    |
| Snare |   |   | X |   |   |   | X |   |   |    | X  |    |    |    | X  |    |
| Hat   | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X  | X  | X  | X  | X  | X  | X  |

### 11.2.2 Real-Time Sequencers: Linear, Looping, Overdub

- Record and play back events as performed (not quantized to steps, unless chosen)
- Linear: One continuous timeline from start to end (DAW-style)
- Looping: Repeat a section, overdub new events (MPC, Ableton Live, Elektron)
- Quantization can be applied post-recording or in real-time

#### 11.2.2.1 Example: Live MIDI Recorder

- Captures note-on/note-off as they occur
- Stores timestamp for each event (tick, ms, PPQN)

### 11.2.3 Pattern-Based Sequencers

- Store musical “patterns” (bars, loops, phrases) separately
- Patterns can be chained, repeated, or triggered live
- Patterns may contain multiple tracks/lanes (drums, bass, melody)
- Allows building songs with reusable building blocks

#### 11.2.3.1 Example: Pattern Chain

- Pattern A (Drums)
- Pattern B (Bass)
- Pattern C (Melody)
- Song: [A x4] → [B x2] → [C x2] → [A+B+C x2]

### 11.2.4 Song/Arrangement Sequencers

- Higher-level arrangement of patterns, sections, or blocks
- Song mode: sequence patterns for full composition
- May support automation, tempo/time signature changes, scene recalls

#### 11.2.4.1 Example: Song Structure

| Section     | Patterns        | Repeats |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Intro       | A              | 2       |
| Verse       | B, C           | 4       |
| Chorus      | D, E           | 2       |
| Bridge      | F              | 1       |
| Outro       | G              | 2       |

### 11.2.5 Hybrid and Modular Sequencers

- Combine step, real-time, and pattern approaches
- Modular: Each track/lane can be a different type of sequencer
- Example: Elektron Octatrack, Polyend Tracker, Deluge

### 11.2.6 Grid/Matrix Sequencers

- Visual grid (8x8, 16x8, etc.), pads/buttons map to time and pitch/lane
- Used for clip launching, step input, live triggering
- Example: Ableton Push, Launchpad, Deluge

#### 11.2.6.1 Example: 8x8 Grid

|       | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Row 1 | X |   | X |   |   | X |   |   |
| ...   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

### 11.2.7 Tracker Sequencers

- Vertical timeline, hexadecimal steps (e.g., 00–3F)
- Each row is a time step; columns for note, instrument, effect, parameter
- Fast data entry with keyboard; originated in Amiga/PC scene
- Example: Renoise, Polyend Tracker, LSDJ

## 11.3 Sequencer Data Structures

### 11.3.1 Steps, Patterns, Songs: Definitions and Hierarchy

#### 11.3.1.1 Step

- Smallest time division (e.g., 1/16 note)
- Holds one or more events: note, velocity, parameter

#### 11.3.1.2 Pattern

- Sequence of steps (length: 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.)
- May be monophonic or polyphonic, contain multiple tracks

#### 11.3.1.3 Song

- Sequence/arrangement of patterns (with repeats, jumps, stops)

#### 11.3.1.4 Hierarchy Example

```plaintext
Song
 ├── Pattern 1
 │    ├── Step 1: Note C4, velocity 100
 │    ├── Step 2: Silence
 │    └── ...
 ├── Pattern 2
 │    └── ...
 └── ...
```

### 11.3.2 Track, Channel, Lane, and Part: Structure and Usage

- **Track:** Independent sequence, often corresponds to instrument or MIDI channel
- **Lane:** Subdivision within a track (e.g., separate lane for note, velocity, CC, automation)
- **Channel:** MIDI channel or audio channel assignment
- **Part:** Logical group, may span multiple patterns or tracks

#### 11.3.2.1 Example Data Structure (C)

```c
typedef struct {
    uint8_t note;
    uint8_t velocity;
    uint8_t gate;
    uint8_t cc[8];
    uint8_t flags;
} StepEvent;

typedef struct {
    StepEvent steps[16];
    uint8_t length;
    uint8_t track_id;
} Pattern;

typedef struct {
    Pattern patterns[64];
    uint8_t num_patterns;
    char name[32];
} Song;
```

### 11.3.3 Event Representation: Note, Control, Automation

- **Note Event:** MIDI note number, velocity, gate/length, channel
- **Control Event:** MIDI CC value, NRPN, aftertouch, pitch bend
- **Automation Event:** Parameter change over time (filter, FX, etc.)
- **Meta Event:** Tempo, time signature, pattern change, section marker

#### 11.3.3.1 Example Event Encoding

```c
typedef enum { EVT_NOTE, EVT_CC, EVT_AUTOMATION, EVT_META } EventType;
typedef struct {
    EventType type;
    uint32_t  tick;      // Absolute or relative time
    union {
        struct { uint8_t note, vel, len, ch; } note;
        struct { uint8_t cc, val, ch; } cc;
        struct { uint8_t param, val; } automation;
        struct { uint8_t meta, val; } meta;
    };
} SeqEvent;
```

### 11.3.4 Time Representation: PPQN, Ticks, Bars, Beats, Step Index

- **PPQN (Pulses Per Quarter Note):** MIDI standard, defines time resolution (e.g., 24, 96, 192, 384)
- **Tick:** Smallest time unit, relative to PPQN
- **Bar/Beat:** Musical divisions (e.g., 4/4 time: 4 beats per bar)
- **Step Index:** For step sequencers, maps to tick/bar/beat

#### 11.3.4.1 Example: 16-Step, 4/4, 96 PPQN

| Step | Tick | Beat | Bar |
|------|------|------|-----|
| 1    | 0    | 1    | 1   |
| 2    | 24   | 1    | 1   |
| 3    | 48   | 2    | 1   |
| ...  | ...  | ...  | ... |

### 11.3.5 Handling Polyphony and Overlapping Events

- Store note-on/note-off with unique IDs for each voice
- Allow stacking of notes per step (chords, drum hits)
- Handle overlapping notes (tie, legato, retrigger rules)
- Parameter locks: per-step automation, “p-locks” (Elektron style)

### 11.3.6 Memory Management for Sequencer Data

- Use arrays for fixed-size grids (steps, patterns)
- Linked lists or ring buffers for real-time/linear events
- Dynamic allocation or pre-allocated pools for limited hardware
- Save/restore to flash, SD, or battery-backed RAM

### 11.3.7 Saving, Loading, and File Formats (MIDI, Custom, Open)

- **Standard MIDI File (SMF):** Universal, but lacks advanced features (parameter locks, complex automation)
- **Custom Binary/JSON:** For advanced or proprietary features (Elektron, Polyend, Deluge, MPC, OP-Z)
- **Open Formats:** e.g. Seq24, Sonic Pi, Renoise XML, MOD/XM/S3M for trackers

#### 11.3.7.1 MIDI File Example

- Sequence of events with absolute/relative ticks
- Type 0: single track, Type 1: multitrack

#### 11.3.7.2 Custom File Example

```json
{
  "song": {
    "patterns": [
      {
        "steps": [
          { "note": 60, "vel": 100, "len": 24 },
          { "note": 62, "vel": 90, "len": 24 }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 11.4 Sequencer UI and Hardware Mapping

### 11.4.1 Grid, Row, and Matrix UI Paradigms

- **Row:** Horizontal steps (TR-808, drum machines, classic sequencers)
- **Grid/Matrix:** Step vs. pitch (Launchpad, Push, Deluge)
- **Track View:** Vertical or horizontal, one lane per instrument

### 11.4.2 Displaying Steps, Cursors, and Playhead

- LED/button row: current step lights up (playhead), active steps lit bright
- Display: show pattern, play position, and edit cursor
- Touch/encoder: move, select, edit steps; tap to enter notes

### 11.4.3 Editing: Step, Real-Time, Automation, Parameter Locks

- Step: toggle note/gate, set velocity, assign CC or automation
- Real-time: record as played, then quantize/edit
- Automation: per-step, per-pattern, or continuous
- Parameter locks: lock value to a step (Elektron style)

### 11.4.4 Feedback: LEDs, Displays, and Tactile Cues

- LEDs: show playhead, active steps, mutes, accents, automation
- Displays: pattern names, step values, parameter curves, waveform overlays
- Tactile: haptic feedback (vibration), click detents, aftertouch lights
