## 20.1 Introduction: Why MIDI and External Control Matter in Workstations

MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is the universal language for electronic music devices.  
It allows workstations, synths, drum machines, DAWs, controllers, and effects to communicate for performance, sequencing, automation, and remote control.

**Why MIDI is Essential:**
- Enables control and synchronization between devices from different manufacturers and eras.
- Supports sequencing, automation, patch management, and live performance.
- Provides a common standard for integrating controllers, external synths, software, and more.
- MIDI 2.0 and new protocols (OSC, RTP-MIDI) expand resolution, speed, and feature set for modern workflows.

### 20.2.2 The MIDI 1.0 Protocol: Structure, Messages, and Limitations

- **Bit Rate:** 31.25 kbps, serial, 8-N-1 (one start, eight data, one stop bit).
- **Message Structure:** Status byte (command/channel), followed by 1 or 2 data bytes.
- **Channels:** 16 simultaneous channels per port (1–16).
- **Message Types:** Note On/Off, Control Change, Program Change, Pitchbend, Aftertouch, System Exclusive (SysEx), Clock, Start/Stop, Song Position.
- **Limitations:**
  - Low resolution (7-bit CC, 128 values; 14-bit for pitchbend).
  - Limited bandwidth (running status, no guaranteed timing under heavy traffic).
  - No official standard for per-note controllers (until MPE, MIDI 2.0).
  - No built-in transport for audio or sample data.

### 20.2.3 Physical MIDI: 5-Pin DIN, Mini-Jack, USB MIDI, Wireless

- **Thru Circuit:** Simple buffer copies In data to Thru jack.
- **MIDI Jack Pinout:** Pin 4 = +, Pin 5 = –, Pin 2 = Shield/ground.

#### 20.4.1.1 MIDI In Circuit (Basic)

```plaintext
[DIN Pin 4] --[Resistor]--+--[Optocoupler]--+--[MCU RX]
[DIN Pin 5] --------------+                |
                                          [Ground]
```

- **Internal Bus:** Software abstraction for passing MIDI between synth engines, sequencer, and IO.

### 20.4.3 USB MIDI Host/Device, Class Compliance, and Composite Devices

- **USB Device:** Workstation appears as MIDI interface to host (PC, tablet); class compliant = no drivers needed.
- **USB Host:** Workstation can connect to external MIDI controllers, keyboards, or other devices as host.
- **Composite Devices:** Multiple interfaces (audio, MIDI, storage) over one USB cable; requires correct descriptors.

### 20.4.4 Wireless MIDI (Bluetooth LE, RTP-MIDI, WiFi)

- **Bluetooth LE MIDI:** Supported on iOS, macOS, Windows, Android; 7–10ms latency typical, sometimes higher.
- **RTP-MIDI:** MIDI over Ethernet, allows many ports, long range; used in studios/venues.
- **WiFi MIDI:** Custom protocols, higher latency/jitter, but useful for some remote control (e.g., OSC apps).

### 20.4.5 MIDI Merge, Split, and Filter Logic in Embedded Systems

- **Merge:** Combine input streams (e.g., controller + DAW) in firmware; resolve collisions by time, channel, priority.
- **Split:** Route specific channels/notes/CCs to different outputs or synth engines.
- **Filter:** Block or remap unwanted data (e.g., ignore all aftertouch, remap CC 1 to CC 74).
- **Implementation:** Hardware (logic gates, microcontrollers), firmware, or software (embedded Linux).
