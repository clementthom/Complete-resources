## 35.300 Performance Tuning and Calibration

### 35.300.1 Audio Latency and Buffer Optimization

- **Measuring Latency**:
  - Use loopback (audio out to in) and a DAW or oscilloscope.
  - Tools: `jack_delay`, `latencytop`, `cyclictest`, and built-in diagnostics.
  - Typical targets: <10ms round-trip for live use, <5ms preferred for pro workflow.
- **Optimizing Buffer Size**:
  - Lower buffer = lower latency but higher CPU usage.
  - Test stability at 32/64/128/256/512 samples per buffer.
  - On embedded Linux: tune ALSA/JACK/PipeWire for minimum safe size.
- **DMA and ISR**:
  - On MCUs, ensure DMA buffer size is a power of two, minimize ISR overhead, and avoid blocking calls.
- **Thread Priorities**:
  - Audio/DSP threads should be highest-priority (SCHED_FIFO/RR on Linux).
  - Pin threads to isolated cores if possible.
- **Dynamic Buffering**:
  - Implement buffer size adjustment in UI for troubleshooting and optimization.

### 35.300.2 DSP and FX Benchmarking

- **DSP Load Testing**:
  - Profile CPU usage with and without FX.
  - Tools: `htop`, `perf`, custom timing logs.
  - Test with all FX enabled, highest polyphony, and worst-case scenarios (long reverb tails, granular FX, etc.).
- **Real-Time FX Menu**:
  - Switch between complex effects (FFT multiply, convolution, spectral morph) in real-time, measure impact.
- **Optimization**:
  - Use SIMD/NEON for vector DSP.
  - Offload background or non-critical DSP to lower-priority threads.
- **Benchmark Results Table Example**:

| Effect              | CPU @ 44.1kHz | Polyphony | Latency Added |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Spectral Multiply   | 32%           | 8 voices  | 11ms         |
| Crossfade Loop      | 5%            | -         | 1ms          |
| Reverb (Algorithmic)| 18%           | 16 voices | 2ms          |
| AI Stem Separation  | 80%           | 1 stem    | 50ms         |

### 35.300.3 MIDI Timing and Jitter Measurement

- **Jitter Sources**:
  - USB stack, ISR priorities, buffer overflows.
- **Measurement**:
  - Send MIDI clock or note-on, loopback to input, log timestamp deltas.
  - Use high-resolution timers, log to file for analysis.
- **Targets**:
  - <1ms timing jitter for pro MIDI performance.
- **Compensation**:
  - Timestamp in ISR, batch processing where unavoidable, avoid main loop polling for MIDI.

### 35.300.4 Power, Thermal, and Stability Tests

- **Power Profiling**:
  - Measure average and peak current draw (idle, load, FX-heavy, screen full-bright).
  - Ensure battery life meets requirements (record results at idle, typical, and max usage).
- **Thermal Testing**:
  - Monitor CPU/GPU/codec temps with sensors (`vcgencmd`, `lm-sensors`, ADC).
  - Stress test with all subsystems enabled; watch for throttling or failures.
- **Stability**:
  - Run for 24–72 hours (“burn-in”), log errors, check for memory leaks, CPU stalls, audio glitches.

### 35.300.5 Calibration: Inputs, Controls, CV/Gate

- **Audio Calibration**:
  - Use reference sine sweep for input gain/linearity.
  - Calibrate output levels, headphone amp, check for crosstalk.
- **Controls**:
  - Test encoder, pad, fader ranges; tune debounce and velocity curves.
- **CV/Gate**:
  - Verify 1V/oct, Hz/V scaling, gate logic level; measure with DMM/oscilloscope.
  - Store calibration data in NVRAM, expose recalibration utility in menu.

## 35.301 Extended Testing and Validation

### 35.301.1 Automated Test Suites and Regression Testing

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Core engine, DSP routines, MIDI parser, file I/O.
  - Use GoogleTest (C++), Unity (C), pytest (Python), custom scripts.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Run full audio/MIDI paths, load/save projects, apply FX chains.
- **Regression Suites**:
  - Maintain test cases for old bugs; rerun after code changes.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
  - Automated build and test runs for every commit (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).

### 35.301.2 User Scenario Validation: Live, Studio, Remote

- **Live Use**:
  - Rapid power-on, instant playback, fast patch switching, all controls accessible.
  - Test for robustness against accidental disconnects (power, MIDI, USB).
- **Studio Use**:
  - Multitrack recording, DAW sync, sample import/export, automation with external gear.
- **Remote/Companion App**:
  - Wireless control, file transfer, parameter remote, web UI tested on phones/tablets/laptops.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Test for colorblind/low vision modes, keyboard navigation, alternate input devices.

### 35.301.3 Failover, Recovery, and Long-Term Stress Testing

- **Power Loss Recovery**:
  - Simulate abrupt power cut, verify no data loss or corruption.
  - Boot into recovery mode, rollback to last known-good image.
- **Watchdog Timer**:
  - Verify resets on firmware hang or software lock.
- **Long-Term Run**:
  - 24–72 hour “soak test”: verify no memory leaks, CPU lockups, thermal events.
  - Log and report all crashes, buffer overruns, and error events.
- **Field Update Test**:
  - Apply update in the field, rollback on failure, verify persistent user data.

### 35.301.4 Field Test and Beta Feedback Collection

- **Beta Hardware Distribution**:
  - Ship/test with trusted users, gather structured feedback (Google Forms, GitHub Issues, email).
- **Bug Reports**:
  - Encourage detailed logs, reproduction steps, system info.
- **User Experience Logs**:
  - Anonymous telemetry (opt-in), crash dump uploads, usage pattern analysis.
- **Community Iteration**:
  - Weekly updates, respond to issues, track feature requests, publish changelogs.
