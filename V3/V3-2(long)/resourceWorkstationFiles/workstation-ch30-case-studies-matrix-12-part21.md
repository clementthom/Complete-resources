## 30.185 Power Distribution: Routing, Filtering, and Decoupling

### 30.185.1 Main Power Entry: IEC, Fusing, and Switches

- **IEC Inlet**:  
  - Standard IEC C14 power entry, with built-in fuse and voltage selector.
  - Dual fusing (live/neutral) for safety; rated at 2–3A slow-blow for initial inrush.
- **Switches**:  
  - Panel power switch interrupts live line post-IEC for safety.
  - Neon/LED indicator wired to show power state.

### 30.185.2 Power Rails: +15V, –15V, +5V, Ground Topology

- **Analog Rails**:  
  - ±15V for VCO, VCF, VCA, S/H, and analog buffers.
  - Tolerances: ±0.2V; drift can cause tuning/filter errors.
- **Digital Rail**:  
  - +5V for CPU, logic, panel, LCD; isolated from analog return.
- **Ground Topology**:  
  - Single star ground at PSU return; analog/digital returns kept separate until star point.
  - Chassis earth bonded at IEC for safety and RF shielding.

### 30.185.3 PCB Power Routing: Star vs. Daisy Chain, Voltage Drop Analysis

- **Star Routing**:  
  - Power rails radiate from PSU to each voice card and panel, minimizing crosstalk.
  - Each card has dedicated ground and supply wires; prevents "ground bounce."
- **Daisy Chain Risks**:  
  - Daisy-chained cards risk voltage drop, ground loops, and increased noise.
- **Voltage Drop**:  
  - For 12 cards at 50mA each, 0.5mm² wire, <0.1V drop per meter.

### 30.185.4 Local Regulation and Decoupling: Per-Card and Per-IC Filtering

- **Per-Card Filtering**:  
  - 100µF electrolytic + 0.1µF ceramic across each card supply pin.
  - Ferrite bead on supply input for HF noise rejection.
- **Per-IC Decoupling**:  
  - 0.1µF ceramic at every IC power pin; 1µF tantalum on critical analog paths.
  - Layout: shortest possible trace from cap to pin.

### 30.185.5 Inrush, Transient, and EMI Protection

- **Inrush**:  
  - NTC thermistor or relay-based soft start for large PSU caps.
- **Transient**:  
  - MOVs or TVS diodes at mains input; snubbers on transformer.
- **EMI**:  
  - Line filter module (Schaffner, Corcom) at power entry; earth bond for shield.

## 30.186 Thermal Management: Case Design, Heat Sinks, and Ventilation

### 30.186.1 Heat Sources: Regulators, Voice Cards, Panel

- **Regulators**:  
  - 7815/7915/7805 linear regs dissipate significant heat; must be mounted to case or large heat sinks.
  - Each can dissipate 5–10W under full load.
- **Voice Cards**:  
  - Each card ~1–2W (analog ICs, opamps, S/H, LEDs).
- **Panel**:  
  - Backlit LCD, LED drivers, and logic add minor heat.

### 30.186.2 Heat Sink Types: Chassis-Mounted, PCB-Mounted, and Thermal Pads

- **Chassis-Mounted**:  
  - Main regulators bolted directly to rear panel (thermal paste and insulation).
- **PCB-Mounted**:  
  - Small sinks for hot analog ICs (VCOs, VCAs) if case airflow is poor.
- **Thermal Pads**:  
  - Silicone pads under regulators for electrical isolation and good thermal transfer.

### 30.186.3 Ventilation: Case Slots, Fan Retrofits, and Airflow Patterns

- **Case Slots**:  
  - Top/rear louvered slots over regulators and cards; bottom intake slots for convection.
- **Fan Retrofits**:  
  - Low-noise 12V fan, temperature-controlled via firmware or analog sensor.
- **Airflow**:  
  - Front-bottom to rear-top; avoid blocking with cables or foam.

### 30.186.4 Thermal Monitoring: Sensing, Firmware Response, and Fail-Safes

- **Sensors**:  
  - Analog thermistor or digital IC (e.g., LM75, TMP102) near regulators and cards.
- **Firmware**:  
  - Polls sensors every second; logs overtemp, triggers fan or reduces brightness.
- **Fail-Safes**:  
  - If overtemp persists: mute audio, display warning, and (optionally) shut down.

## 30.187 Shielding, Grounding, and Noise Immunity

### 30.187.1 Analog vs. Digital Ground: Star Point, Plane, and Chassis Bonding

- **Star Point**:  
  - All analog and digital returns meet at one point in PSU.
- **Ground Plane**:  
  - Analog and digital ground planes separated on PCB, joined only at star.
- **Chassis Bonding**:  
  - Shield wires from audio jacks bond to chassis, not logic ground.

### 30.187.2 Cable Shielding: Audio, CV, MIDI, and Panel Interconnects

- **Audio/CV**:  
  - Shielded, twisted-pair cable for all audio and CV runs.
  - Shield grounded at one end (star) to avoid ground loops.
- **MIDI**:  
  - Twisted pair, opto-coupled at input, shield grounded at panel.

### 30.187.3 EMI/RFI Mitigation: Ferrites, Filtering, and PCB Layout

- **Ferrite Beads**:  
  - On all supply, audio, and panel lines entering/leaving PCB.
- **Filtering**:  
  - RC or LC filters on noisy or critical lines (e.g., panel, MIDI).
- **PCB Layout**:  
  - Keep analog and digital signals separate; minimize loop area.
  - Short direct runs for high-frequency or sensitive lines.

### 30.187.4 Hum, Buzz, and Ground Loop Diagnostics

- **Diagnostics**:  
  - Use audio probe to trace hum/buzz origin.
  - Lift ground on audio output (via ground lift switch or transformer) for test.
  - Check for unintentional ground paths (e.g., mounting screws bridging planes).

## 30.188 Long-Term Reliability: Aging, Failure Modes, and Preventive Maintenance

### 30.188.1 Capacitor Aging: Electrolytic, Tantalum, and Film Types

- **Electrolytics**:  
  - Dry out over 10–20 years; ESR rises, capacitance falls, risk of leakage.
- **Tantalum**:  
  - Stable, but can fail short if overvolted or reverse biased.
- **Film Caps**:  
  - Very long life; rare failures except in high humidity.

### 30.188.2 Contact Wear: Switches, Connectors, and Relays

- **Switches**:  
  - Panel buttons wear out; gold-plated contacts last longer.
- **Connectors**:  
  - Ribbon cables, edge connectors oxidize; periodic cleaning/retension needed.
- **Relays**:  
  - Used for mains switching in some builds; points may pit/burn.

### 30.188.3 IC/Transistor Reliability: ESD, Thermal, and Drift

- **ESD**:  
  - MOS ICs (CEM, opamps, logic) sensitive to static; handle with care.
- **Thermal**:  
  - Overheating shortens IC life; service fans/heatsinks regularly.
- **Drift**:  
  - VCO/VCF parameters may shift over decades; recalibration needed.

### 30.188.4 Battery and Patch RAM: Data Loss, Corrosion, and Upgrade Paths

- **Battery**:  
  - Original NiCd or lithium cell; risk of leakage/corrosion.
  - Modern upgrade: FRAM or supercap + EEPROM for patch storage.
- **Patch RAM**:  
  - If battery is low, data may become corrupted or lost; check voltage regularly.

### 30.188.5 Preventive Maintenance: Cleaning, Recapping, and Firmware Updates

- **Cleaning**:  
  - Blow out dust, clean contacts annually.
- **Recapping**:  
  - Replace electrolytics every 10–20 years or if ESR is high.
- **Firmware**:  
  - Update OS to fix bugs, support new features, and maintain compatibility.
