## 30.180 System Timing: Master Clock, Event Scheduling, and Jitter Analysis

### 30.180.1 Master Clock Design: Crystal, Dividers, and Distribution

- **Crystal Source**:  
  - 12MHz quartz crystal, buffered by inverter chain (74HC04), distributed via star topology.
- **Frequency Dividers**:  
  - Synchronous counters (74HC393) divide master clock into 1MHz (CPU), 1kHz (panel/UI), and 31.25kHz (UART/MIDI).
- **Distribution**:  
  - Matched-length traces, series resistors for signal integrity.
  - Each domain (CPU, panel, MIDI, expansion) receives dedicated buffer.

### 30.180.2 Timing Wheel: Scheduling, Priority Queues, and Soft Timers

- **Timing Wheel**:  
  - Ring buffer of N slots, each slot contains list of events scheduled for that tick.
  - On each tick (e.g., 1ms), wheel advances, executes due events.
- **Priority Queues**:  
  - Critical events (matrix update, DAC refresh) get highest priority.
  - Lower-priority (LCD update, backup) scheduled in slack time.
- **Soft Timers**:  
  - Software timers for envelope/LFO, debounce, menu timeouts.

### 30.180.3 Jitter Sources: Interrupts, Bus Contention, and Mitigation

- **Interrupts**:  
  - Timer, UART/MIDI, panel, voice bus; poorly planned ISRs create jitter.
- **Bus Contention**:  
  - Shared data/address lines: bus arbitration logic prevents conflicts.
- **Mitigation**:  
  - Keep ISRs short, move work to main loop; buffer DAC updates.
  - Use DMA (on modern MCU) for high-precision tasks.

### 30.180.4 Benchmarking: Real-World Timing, Measurement, and Optimization

- **Measurement**:
  - Logic analyzer on DAC, panel, and MIDI lines; measure latency/jitter.
  - CPU cycle counters (where available) log event timing.
- **Optimization**:
  - Profile code to minimize update cycle; optimize matrix and DAC routines.
  - Track missed deadlines, adjust scheduling priorities.

## 30.181 Polyphony Scaling: Multi-Matrix, Chaining, and Voice Expansion

### 30.181.1 Hardware Limits: Original Design and Bus Load

- **Original**:  
  - 12 independent voice cards, each with full analog and CV lines.
  - Bus limited by address/data fanout, rise/fall times, capacitance.
- **Scaling**:  
  - Max reliable bus length: ~16 voices; further requires bus repeaters or segmentation.

### 30.181.2 Multi-Unit Chaining: MIDI, Net, and Clock Sync

- **Chaining**:  
  - Multiple Matrix-12s linked via MIDI; one is master, others set to slave.
  - MIDI clock, program change, macro, and patch data broadcast to all.
- **Network**:  
  - RTP-MIDI or OSC over Ethernet for tighter sync and lower latency.
  - Peer-to-peer or star topology for large setups.

### 30.181.3 Voice Expansion: Bus Arbitration, ID, and Auto-Detection

- **Bus Arbitration**:  
  - Each voice card responds to its unique address; expansion cards register on boot.
- **ID/Auto-Detection**:  
  - Cards report ID/version at power-up; main CPU builds polyphony map.
- **Firmware**:  
  - Dynamic allocation, per-card diagnostics, and error/fault masking.

### 30.181.4 Dynamic Polyphony Allocation: Load Balancing and Split Modes

- **Load Balancing**:  
  - When some cards are masked/faulty, available voices are distributed among splits/layers.
- **Split Modes**:  
  - E.g., 6+6, 8+4, 12+0; dynamic adjustment as voices are added/removed.
- **Voice Stealing**:  
  - Least-recently-used or lowest-amplitude voice is reassigned for new notes.

## 30.182 External Control: Editors, Automation, and DAW Integration

### 30.182.1 Sysex Editors: Patch Management, Parameter Morph, and Bulk Dump

- **Patch Management**:  
  - Editor reads/writes full patch via sysex (see Part 10/16); supports bank management, metadata, and history.
- **Parameter Morph**:  
  - Editor sends real-time parameter changes; supports morphing between states, macros, and automation curves.
- **Bulk Dump**:  
  - All patches, calibration tables, and user data can be dumped/restored for backup or mass-editing.

### 30.182.2 Automation: Real-Time CC, NRPN, and Macro Sync

- **CC/NRPN**:  
  - Assignable CCs and NRPNs mapped to any parameter or macro; high-resolution (14-bit) where supported.
- **Macro Sync**:  
  - Macros synchronized to DAW/host automation; live or sequenced performance mapped to matrix mod.

### 30.182.3 DAW Integration: Plugin, Web UI, and Live Feedback

- **Plugin**:  
  - VST/AU plugin acts as librarian, real-time controller, and patch editor.
  - Two-way communication: DAW automation updates synth, synth parameter changes update plugin.
- **Web UI**:  
  - Browser-based remote control, patch management, and diagnostics (see Part 16).
- **Live Feedback**:  
  - Parameter changes, errors, and patch morph visualized in real time.

### 30.182.4 API/Protocol Extensions: For Community Firmware

- **API**:  
  - JSON, OSC, or custom binary protocol for third-party apps.
- **Firmware Extensions**:  
  - Open source firmware hooks for custom features, e.g., new mod sources, custom scales, or alternate tuning.

    if (data[0] == SYSEX_PATCH_DUMP) import_patch(data+1, len-1);
    else if (data[0] == SYSEX_PARAM_CHANGE) {
        uint16_t param = (data[1] << 8) | data[2];
        uint16_t val = (data[3] << 8) | data[4];
        set_patch_param(&edit_buf.patch, param, val);
    }
}

void handle_cc(uint8_t cc, uint8_t val) {
    if (cc >= MACRO_CC_BASE && cc < MACRO_CC_BASE + 8) {
