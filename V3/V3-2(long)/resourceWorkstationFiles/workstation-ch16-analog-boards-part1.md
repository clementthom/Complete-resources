## 16.1 Introduction: Why Analog Still Matters in Modern Workstations

Even in a digital era, analog audio circuits remain essential for workstations, synths, samplers, and effects.  
Why?
- **Sound Quality:** Analog mixing and filtering can impart warmth, color, saturation, and subtle nonlinearities that many musicians find pleasing.
- **I/O Versatility:** Analog boards interface with microphones, instruments, modular synths, speakers, and legacy/studio gear.
- **Performance:** Low-latency, real-time routing not limited by digital processing headroom or buffer sizes.
- **Reliability:** Analog circuits can be robust, easy to repair, and tolerant of power cycles.
- **Hybrid Designs:** Most modern digital workstations still rely on analog front-ends and outputs for best results.

This chapter provides a **detailed, step-by-step, beginner-friendly guide** to analog audio board design, from fundamentals to real-world mixing circuits.

## 16.2 Analog Audio Fundamentals

### 16.2.1 Analog vs. Digital Audio: Key Differences and Use Cases

- **Analog Audio:** Continuous electrical signal, voltage/current corresponds directly to sound pressure.
- **Digital Audio:** Discrete samples (e.g., 44.1kHz), converted by ADC/DAC.
- **Use Cases:**
  - **Analog:** Preamp, filter, mixer, EQ, summing, legacy FX, modular synths.
  - **Digital:** Processing, storage, effects, sequencing, recall.
- **Analog Strengths:** No quantization noise, “natural” saturation/overload, instant response.
- **Digital Strengths:** Precise, repeatable, programmable, complex routing.

### 16.2.2 Signal Levels: Line, Instrument, Mic, Modular, Pro vs. Consumer

| Signal Type  | Level Typical | Peak Volts | Impedance | Application         |
|--------------|--------------|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Line (Pro)   | +4 dBu       | ~1.23 V    | 10–50kΩ   | Mixers, studio gear |
| Line (Cons.) | -10 dBV      | ~0.316 V   | 10–50kΩ   | Hi-fi, consumer     |
| Mic          | -60 to -40 dBu| 1–10 mV   | 1–2kΩ     | Mics, DI            |
| Inst (Hi-Z)  | -20 dBu      | ~0.1 V     | 500k–2MΩ  | Guitar, bass        |
| Modular      | 5–10 Vpp     | ±5 V       | ~100kΩ    | Eurorack, synth     |

- **Headroom:** Keep signals below clipping, above noise floor.
- **Matching:** Use correct input for source; mismatches cause noise, distortion, weak signal.

### 16.2.3 Impedance, Grounding, and Shielding

- **Impedance Matching:** Input impedance should be much higher than source output (rule of thumb: 10×)
- **Grounding:** Single-point (star) ground preferred; prevents ground loops and hum.
- **Shielding:** Use shielded cable for all audio lines; connect shield to ground at one end only for long runs.

#### 16.2.3.1 Ground Loop Example

```
[Device A]-----(Audio Cable)-----[Device B]
    |                                  |
   (Ground A)---------------------(Ground B)
      |_______________________|
      (Loop picks up hum from AC, lights, etc.)
```

- **Fix:** Use balanced lines, ground lifts, isolation transformers as needed.

### 16.2.4 Audio Connectors and Cabling: TS, TRS, XLR, RCA, Bantam, Patchbays

- **TS (Tip-Sleeve):** Unbalanced mono (guitar cables)
- **TRS (Tip-Ring-Sleeve):** Stereo or balanced mono (headphones, line)
- **XLR:** Balanced mono (mic, pro audio, long cables)
- **RCA/Phono:** Unbalanced, consumer line (CD, home stereo)
- **Bantam/TT:** Patchbays, pro studios (tiny telephone)
- **Patchbays:** Central panel for routing, normalled/tapped connections

#### 16.2.4.1 Pinouts

| Connector | Tip   | Ring     | Sleeve   |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------|
| TS        | Signal| —        | Ground   |
| TRS       | L/Hot | R/Cold   | Ground   |
| XLR (1/2/3)|1-Gnd | 2-Hot    | 3-Cold   |

### 16.2.5 Noise, Distortion, and Signal Integrity

- **Noise:** Hiss (thermal), hum (mains), buzz (digital clocks), radio (RF)
- **Distortion:** Clipping (harsh), crossover (class B), intermodulation (multiple signals), harmonic (pleasant in moderation)
- **Signal Integrity:** Keep cables short, balanced if possible, avoid power/audio wire overlap, use proper PCB layout.

#### 16.2.5.1 SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)

- SNR = 20*log10(signal_rms/noise_rms), higher is better (60–100dB+ is typical)
- Shielding, PCB layout, power supply design all affect SNR.

## 16.3 Mixing Circuits and Architectures

### 16.3.1 What is Mixing? Summing, Routing, and Gain Staging

- **Mixing:** Combine multiple audio signals into one or more outputs.
- **Summing:** Electrically add signals together; can be passive (resistors) or active (op-amps).
- **Gain Staging:** Adjust each stage for best SNR and headroom.

### 16.3.2 Passive vs. Active Mixers

- **Passive Mixer:** Uses only resistors to sum signals; cheap, but signal loss, no gain, output impedance is high.
- **Active Mixer:** Uses op-amps to buffer and sum; can provide gain, low output impedance, lower noise.

#### 16.3.2.1 Passive Mixer Schematic

```
[In1]---/\/\/\---+
[In2]---/\/\/\---+----> [Out]
[In3]---/\/\/\---+
```

#### 16.3.2.2 Active Mixer Schematic (Virtual Earth)

```
[In1]---/\/\/\---+
[In2]---/\/\/\---+---(-)OpAmp(+)---[Out]
[In3]---/\/\/\---+
```

- Op-amp inverting input is “virtual ground”, keeps summing point at 0V, minimizes crosstalk.

### 16.3.3 Op-Amp Mixer Circuits: Virtual Earth, Inverting, Non-Inverting

- **Virtual Earth Mixer:** All inputs summed at low impedance, op-amp provides gain and low output impedance.
- **Inverting Mixer:** Signal phase is inverted; can be compensated by another inverting stage.
- **Non-Inverting Mixer:** Less common, more complex for summing multiple channels.

#### 16.3.3.1 Example: Inverting Summing Amplifier

```plaintext
Vout = -Rf * (V1/R1 + V2/R2 + ... + Vn/Rn)
```

- Rf: Feedback resistor, sets gain.
- Ri: Input resistor per channel.

### 16.3.4 Pan, Balance, and Stereo Mixing

- **Pan Pot:** Dual-ganged potentiometer, sends more signal to left or right.
- **Balance Control:** Adjusts ratio between two channels.
- **Stereo Mixers:** Sum left/right separately; pan controls adjust each input's contribution.

#### 16.3.4.1 Pan Law

- Maintains constant power when panning between channels (common: -3dB at center).

### 16.3.5 Aux Sends, Returns, and Insert Loops (Analog FX Integration)

- **Aux Send:** Taps signal before or after channel fader, routes to external FX or monitor.
- **Aux Return:** Brings FX output back into main mix.
- **Insert Loop:** Breaks signal path to insert FX (compressor, EQ) in series with channel.

#### 16.3.5.1 Insert Jack (TRS) Pinout

- Tip: Send
- Ring: Return
- Sleeve: Ground

### 16.3.6 Voltage-Controlled Amplifiers (VCA) in Mixers

- **VCA:** Amplifies audio based on control voltage; enables automated mixing, sidechain compression, velocity response.
- **ICs:** SSM2164, THAT2180/2181, Coolaudio V2164.
- **Applications:** Digital/analog volume control, dynamic panning, envelope shaping.

### 16.3.7 Analog Summing: Theory, Practice, and “Sound”

- **Analog Summing:** Combining tracks in analog domain, sometimes claimed to impart warmth, glue, or depth.
- **Debate:** Some prefer digital summing for precision, others analog for subtle coloration.
- **DIY Summing Boxes:** Popular for hybrid studios; careful design needed to preserve SNR and avoid crosstalk.

## 16.4 Analog Filtering Basics

### 16.4.1 Filter Types: Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass, Notch, Allpass, Comb

- **Lowpass (LPF):** Blocks high frequencies, passes lows.
- **Highpass (HPF):** Blocks lows, passes highs.
- **Bandpass (BPF):** Passes a band near center frequency.
- **Notch/Bandstop:** Removes a band of frequencies (e.g., hum at 60Hz).
- **Allpass:** Passes all frequencies, shifts phase (used for phaser FX).
- **Comb:** Series of notches/peaks, creates resonances or cancellation.

### 16.4.2 RC, RLC, and Op-Amp Filter Circuits

- **RC Filter:** Simplest, one resistor, one capacitor.
  - Highpass: C in series, R to ground.
  - Lowpass: R in series, C to ground.
- **RLC Filter:** Adds inductor for sharper slope, rarely used in modern audio (inductors are bulky, noisy).
- **Op-Amp Active Filter:** Multiple poles, high Q, adjustable frequency/gain.

#### 16.4.2.1 RC Lowpass Equation

```
Fc = 1 / (2πRC)
```
- Fc: cutoff frequency (Hz)
- R: resistance (ohms)
- C: capacitance (farads)

### 16.4.3 Resonance, Q, and Filter Slope

- **Resonance (Q):** Boost at cutoff frequency; higher Q = sharper, more pronounced peak.
- **Slope:** dB/octave; first order = 6dB/oct, second order = 12dB/oct, etc.
- **High-Q:** Can self-oscillate, used for synth sweeps, squelchy FX.

### 16.4.4 Analog Synth Filter Designs: Moog Ladder, Sallen-Key, State Variable

- **Moog Ladder:** Four-stage transistor ladder, classic “warm” sweep, resonance
- **Sallen-Key:** Simple op-amp filter, flexible, often used for state-variable
- **State Variable Filter (SVF):** Simultaneous LPF, HPF, BPF outputs, easily voltage-controlled

#### 16.4.4.1 Moog Ladder Block Diagram

```
[Input] → [Transistor Pair Stages] → [Output]
             ↑
        (Feedback for resonance)
```

### 16.4.5 Voltage-Controlled Filters (VCF): OTA, SSM, CEM, Modern ICs

- **OTA (Operational Transconductance Amplifier):** Classic IC for VCFs (CA3080, LM13700)
- **SSM/CEM Chips:** Classic synth ICs (Roland, Sequential, Oberheim)
- **Modern ICs:** AS3320, Coolaudio, Alfa, SSI — replacements for vintage parts

### 16.4.6 Filter Modulation: Envelopes, LFOs, Tracking, CV

- **Envelope Mod:** Sweep cutoff with ADSR for dynamic sound.
- **LFO Mod:** Cyclic filter movement (wah, auto-wah, phaser).
- **Key Tracking:** Higher notes open filter more.
- **CV Control:** Modular/analog synths use external voltages for filter sweep.

## 16.5 Output Stages and Routing

### 16.5.1 Output Buffers, Line Drivers, and Headphone Amps

- **Buffer:** Op-amp isolates output; low impedance for driving long cables.
- **Line Driver:** Balanced driver (e.g., THAT1646) for pro outputs.
- **Headphone Amp:** Drives low-impedance loads; may need extra current/thermal protection.

### 16.5.2 Balanced vs. Unbalanced Outputs

- **Unbalanced:** One signal + ground (TS, RCA); more prone to noise/hum.
- **Balanced:** Two signals (hot/cold) + ground (XLR, TRS); rejects common-mode noise, better for long cables.

#### 16.5.2.1 Balanced Output Diagram

```
[Signal]+ →--------+
                   |----> [Balanced Cable] → [Diff Amp] → [Speaker]
[Signal]- →--------+
```

### 16.5.3 Protection, Muting, and Pop Suppression

- **Protection:** Series resistor, diode clamps against shorts/overvoltage.
- **Muting:** Relay or FET mute on power-up/down to avoid “pops.”
- **Pop Suppression:** Slow ramp-up of output, DC blocking cap, relay delay.

### 16.5.4 Analog Output to Digital/ADC: Level and Impedance Matching

- **Level Matching:** Pad or amplifier to bring analog signal to ADC range.
- **Impedance Matching:** Buffer to drive ADC input impedance.
- **Anti-Aliasing Filter:** Ensure only audio frequencies reach ADC.

### 16.5.5 Direct Outs, Monitor Outs, and Multi-Bus Routing

- **Direct Out:** Individual channel output for multitrack recording.
- **Monitor Out:** Independent mix for headphones/control room.
- **Multi-Bus:** Route groups of channels (submixes, FX sends, monitor mixes).
