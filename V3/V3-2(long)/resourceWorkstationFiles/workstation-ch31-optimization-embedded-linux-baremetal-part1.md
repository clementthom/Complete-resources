## 31.100 Introduction and Overview

Modern musical workstations and samplers, whether custom hardware or contemporary products, often run on either Embedded Linux or bare metal microcontroller/SoC platforms. Optimizing for each requires understanding the low-level differences in hardware, OS, and real-time behavior that can make or break an audio product. This chapter details architectural choices, practical optimizations, real-time audio strategies, and code-level examples for both Embedded Linux and bare metal, enabling you to build robust, low-latency musical instruments and audio systems.

## 31.101 Embedded Linux vs. Bare Metal: Definitions and Use Cases

### 31.101.1 Embedded Linux: Kernel, Init, and Root Filesystem

- **Embedded Linux**:  
  - A full-featured Linux kernel running on SoCs (ARM, x86, RISC-V, etc.), often with a minimal root filesystem (BusyBox, Buildroot, Yocto).
  - **Kernel**: Monolithic, supports SMP, MMU, and hundreds of drivers.
  - **Init System**: systemd, SysVinit, or minimal init; sets up userspace, mounts rootfs, starts services.
  - **Root Filesystem**: SquashFS, ext4, initramfs; includes ALSA, udev, shell, user apps.
  - **Device Trees**: Describe hardware, drivers, and memory layout to kernel at boot.

- **Advantages**:  
  - Huge range of drivers, networking, filesystems, multi-process multitasking, POSIX APIs.
  - Rich software ecosystem: Python, C++, GUI libraries, networking, web servers, etc.
  - Security features: memory protection, users/groups, SELinux/AppArmor.

- **Disadvantages**:  
  - Higher latency/jitter, more overhead, more complex boot and configuration.
  - Rootfs can be corrupted without care (journaling, wear-leveling needed).
  - Requires more RAM/flash (typically 64MB+ RAM, 128MB+ flash minimum).

### 31.101.2 Bare Metal: Microcontrollers, SoCs, and No-OS Environments

- **Bare Metal**:  
  - No traditional OS; code runs directly on microcontroller/SoC (Cortex-M, STM32, Teensy, ESP32, etc.).
  - **Startup**: Simple bootloader or vector table in ROM; main() runs after reset.
  - **Peripherals**: Accessed via memory-mapped registers.
  - **Scheduling**: Main loop + ISRs (interrupt service routines); no processes/threads unless using an RTOS (FreeRTOS, Zephyr, etc.).
  - **Typical Use**: Small samplers, synthesizers, MIDI controllers, effect pedals.

- **Advantages**:  
  - Ultra-low latency, deterministic timing, instant startup (ms).
  - Tiny memory footprint; can run in 32KB RAM, 128KB flash.
  - Total control over peripherals, power management, and memory.

- **Disadvantages**:  
  - No MMU/memory protection, no dynamic process management.
  - Must implement own drivers for all peripherals.
  - Limited filesystem/networking support.

### 31.101.3 Use Cases: When to Choose Embedded Linux, When to Choose Bare Metal

- **Embedded Linux**:  
  - Needed for complex user interfaces (touch, color LCD, web UI), large RAM/flash, networking, file storage, advanced audio routing, VST plugins, software synths, DAWs.
- **Bare Metal**:  
  - Best for real-time, ultra-low-latency, cost-sensitive, and low-power instruments; simple UI (OLED, buttons), MIDI, analog I/O, or fixed function.

**Decision Table**:

| Feature             | Embedded Linux      | Bare Metal           |
|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Boot Time           | 2–10s              | <100ms               |
| Latency/Jitter      | 1–10ms (with RT)   | <1ms                 |
| UI Complexity       | High (Qt, LVGL)    | Low (buttons, OLED)  |
| File Storage        | Advanced           | Basic (FAT, raw)     |
| Audio Channels      | Many (USB, ALSA)   | Few (I2S, PWM, DAC)  |
| Networking         | Yes (Ethernet, WiFi)| Rare (custom stack)  |
| Power Consumption   | High (100–500mA+)  | Low (10–100mA)       |

## 31.102 Hardware Platforms and Boot Process

### 31.102.1 ARM (Cortex-A, Cortex-M), RISC-V, x86, DSPs, FPGAs

- **ARM Cortex-A**:  
  - Application processors (A7, A9, A53, A72); support Linux, MMU, high clock rates (400MHz–2GHz), up to GBs RAM.
  - Boards: Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, i.MX, STM32MP1, NXP, Allwinner, etc.
- **ARM Cortex-M**:  
  - Microcontrollers (M0, M3, M4, M7, M33, M55); no MMU, up to 600MHz, 32–2048KB RAM.
  - Boards: STM32, NXP LPC, Teensy, Arduino Due, etc.
- **RISC-V**:  
  - Open ISA; SiFive, Allwinner, Espressif; growing ecosystem, both Linux and bare metal.
- **x86 (ATOM, Celeron, etc.)**:  
  - Full Linux, but higher power; used in high-end audio devices or where legacy support is needed.
- **DSPs**:  
  - TI C6000, ADI SHARC, NXP, etc.; used for audio processing, often as co-processors.
- **FPGAs**:  
  - Xilinx, Intel/Altera; can implement audio pipelines, custom buses, or even soft CPUs.

### 31.102.2 Boot Process: ROM, Bootloaders (U-Boot, Barebox), Secure Boot

- **ROM Boot**:  
  - CPU/SoC starts from internal ROM; loads first-stage bootloader from flash, SD, or eMMC.
- **Bootloader**:  
  - U-Boot, Barebox, Das U-Boot; initializes DRAM, loads Linux kernel and device tree, sets up environment, can validate firmware images (secure boot).
- **Bare Metal**:  
  - Vector table jump, minimal bootloader (often just a jump to main firmware).
- **Secure Boot**:  
  - Encrypted/signed images, hardware root of trust.

### 31.102.3 Device Trees and Hardware Abstraction

- **Device Tree Blob (DTB)**:  
  - Binary description of hardware; tells Linux kernel about memory map, peripherals, clocks, GPIO, I2C, SPI, audio codec, etc.
- **Overlay**:  
  - Add/modify device tree nodes at boot (for capes/hats/daughterboards).
- **Bare Metal**:  
  - Hardware mapped directly in code; often hardcoded addresses.

### 31.102.4 Memory Map, MMU, Cache, and TLB

- **Memory Map**:  
  - Flash, RAM, peripherals all mapped to fixed address ranges.
- **MMU**:  
  - Present on Cortex-A/x86; provides virtual memory, process isolation, page tables.
- **Cache and TLB**:  
  - L1/L2 data/instruction cache; TLB for virtual-to-physical translation.
  - Need to flush/invalidate on DMA or during real-time audio for cache coherency.

## 31.103 Real-Time Audio and Determinism

### 31.103.1 Real-Time Constraints in Music Workstations

- **Hard Real-Time**:  
  - Missed deadlines = audio dropouts, glitches, or missed notes.
  - Latency targets:  
    - Synth/Instrument: <3ms end-to-end
    - Sampler/DAW: <10ms buffer-to-output
    - MIDI: <1ms event-to-sound
- **Sources of Latency**:  
  - Kernel scheduling, interrupt latency, buffer size, DMA setup, cache misses, driver delays.

### 31.103.2 Scheduling: PREEMPT_RT, SCHED_FIFO, and Low-Latency Kernels

- **PREEMPT_RT Patch**:  
  - Converts Linux kernel to near-real-time; interrupts become kernel threads, lower scheduling latency.
  - Enables SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR for user processes.
- **Low-Latency Kernel**:  
  - CONFIG_PREEMPT, CONFIG_HZ_1000, disables some power management features.
- **SCHED_FIFO**:  
  - Real-time periodic threads; no timeslice, runs until blocked or yields.
- **Priority Inversion**:  
  - Use priority inheritance locks or avoid shared resources.

### 31.103.3 Interrupts, ISRs, and DMA

- **Interrupts**:  
  - External (audio codec, timer) and internal (DMA complete, error).
- **ISRs**:  
  - Keep short, defer heavy work to threads or main loop.
- **DMA**:  
  - Direct Memory Access for sample transfer; minimizes CPU use, must sync with cache.
- **Interrupt Storms**:  
  - Too many interrupts can cause missed audio deadlines; batch or coalesce where possible.

### 31.103.4 Timer, Clock Sources, and Sample-Accurate Scheduling

- **Timers**:  
  - HPET, ARM SysTick, General-Purpose Timer; used for audio tick, sequencer, LFO, envelopes.
- **Clock Sources**:  
  - Internal oscillators, PLL, external crystal; must be low-jitter for audio.
- **Sample-Accurate Events**:  
  - Schedule MIDI/note events, envelopes, and LFOs aligned to audio sample clock.

### 31.103.5 Jitter, Latency, and Buffer Management

- **Jitter**:  
  - Unpredictable delay in event timing; causes audio artifacts.
- **Latency**:  
  - Total time from input (MIDI/keyboard) to output (audio/DAC).
- **Buffer Management**:  
  - Double-buffering, circular buffering; buffer size vs. latency tradeoff.
  - Under/overrun protection: handle xruns gracefully.

## 31.104 Audio Subsystems and Drivers

### 31.104.1 ALSA and OSS: Linux Audio Stack

- **ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)**:  
  - Kernel drivers for audio interfaces, PCM devices, MIDI, sequencer.
  - User-space API: libasound, aplay/arecord, PCM, mixer, control, timer.
  - Supports hardware and software mixing, MIDI routing, plugin effects.

- **OSS (Open Sound System)**:  
  - Legacy API, limited features, mostly replaced by ALSA.

### 31.104.2 JACK, PulseAudio, and PipeWire

- **JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit)**:  
  - Pro audio server, low-latency, real-time routing, sample-accurate sync, MIDI, netjack.
  - Used for DAWs, synths, softsamplers, modular patching.
- **PulseAudio**:  
  - Desktop audio server; not ideal for real-time/pro audio.
- **PipeWire**:  
  - Next-gen audio/video server; aims to unify JACK, PulseAudio, and video.

### 31.104.3 Custom Audio Drivers for Bare Metal

- **I2S, SAI, PWM, DAC**:  
  - Direct register programming; set up DMA, configure frame/word clocks, enable interrupts.
- **Driver Skeleton**:  
  - Init codec, enable clocks, configure DMA, ISR for buffer swap, underrun/overrun detection.
- **Audio Path**:  
  - [Buffer]->[DMA]->[Codec]->[Output]; latency dominated by buffer size and ISR response.

### 31.104.4 DMA Audio, Circular Buffers, and Double Buffering

- **DMA**:  
  - Set up for ping-pong (double) buffers; swap on DMA complete interrupt.
- **Circular Buffers**:  
  - For MIDI/event queues, continuous audio streams.
- **Buffering Strategy**:  
  - Smallest buffer for latency, but large enough to avoid underruns.

### 31.104.5 Interrupt Latency: Analysis and Mitigation

- **Sources**:  
  - High-priority ISRs, shared IRQ lines, cache misses, kernel lock contention.
- **Mitigation**:  
  - Isolate audio IRQs, pin threads to CPUs (CPU affinity), disable C-states/turbo, pre-allocate memory, lock pages (mlockall).

## 31.105 Filesystems, Storage, and I/O

### 31.105.1 Flash, SD, SATA, and NVMe on Embedded Platforms

- **Flash (NAND/NOR)**:  
  - Used for firmware, OS, user data; requires wear leveling and bad block management.
- **SD/MMC**:  
  - Removable storage; SPI or 4-bit SDIO interface.
- **SATA/NVMe**:  
  - For high-end boards (Pi 5, x86 SBCs); much faster, but higher power and cost.

### 31.105.2 Filesystem Choices: ext4, FAT, F2FS, JFFS2, UBIFS, custom

- **ext4**:  
  - Default for Linux; journaling, robust, good for SD/HDD/SSD.
- **FAT**:  
  - For compatibility (SD cards, USB), lacks journaling, prone to corruption if power loss.
- **F2FS**:  
  - Flash-optimized, better for eMMC, SD.
- **JFFS2/UBIFS**:  
  - For raw NAND; wear leveling, power-fail safe.
- **Custom**:  
  - Sometimes used in bare metal for simple audio recorders (FAT, raw, or custom log-structured).

### 31.105.3 Wear Leveling, Journaling, and Data Integrity

- **Wear Leveling**:  
  - Ensures even usage of flash blocks; prevents premature failure.
- **Journaling**:  
  - Protects against corruption on unexpected reset/power loss.
- **Data Integrity**:  
  - CRC, ECC, atomic writes, file system checks (fsck).

### 31.105.4 I/O Performance, Buffering, and Direct I/O

- **I/O Bottlenecks**:  
  - SD/USB: subject to latency spikes, slow random writes.
  - SCSI/SATA: much faster, but larger power/boot overhead.
- **Buffering**:  
  - Read/write caches; direct I/O to avoid page cache for large audio files.
- **Async I/O**:  
  - Use non-blocking APIs or DMA for storage to avoid blocking real-time audio.

    start_dma(audio_buf[cur_buf], BUF_SIZE);
    fill_audio(audio_buf[!cur_buf], BUF_SIZE);
}

void main() {
    fill_audio(audio_buf[0], BUF_SIZE);
    fill_audio(audio_buf[1], BUF_SIZE);

    } else {
        fill_buffer(next_data, BUF_SIZE);
    }
}
```

    send_cmd(CMD17, block);
    wait_for_data();
    for (int i = 0; i < 512; ++i)
        buf[i] = read_byte();
    return 0;
}
```
