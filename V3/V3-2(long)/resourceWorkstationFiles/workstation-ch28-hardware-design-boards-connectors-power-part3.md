## 28.14 Advanced Audio Hardware Design

### 28.14.1 High-Performance ADC/DAC Topologies

- **Delta-Sigma (ΔΣ) ADC/DAC:** Most common in modern audio; excellent linearity, low noise, high dynamic range.
- **SAR (Successive Approximation):** Used for control signals, not audio (lower resolution, higher speed).
- **Multi-bit vs. Single-bit Delta-Sigma:** Multi-bit (4-6 bits) offers better SNR and less idle tone.
- **Differential Inputs/Outputs:** Reject common-mode noise, critical for pro audio.
- **Clock Domain:** All high-performance ADC/DACs require ultra-low jitter clocks—use dedicated crystals and short PCB traces.
- **Power:** Separate analog and digital supplies; LDOs for analog, ferrite beads, and bulk caps.

#### 28.14.1.1 Example: AKM/WM/Cirrus Audio Codec Block

```
[IN]--[Diff Amp]--[LPF]--[ΔΣ ADC]--[I2S]-->[CPU/DSP]
[CPU/DSP]--[I2S]--[ΔΣ DAC]--[LPF]--[Line Driver]--[OUT]
```

### 28.14.2 Low-Noise Analog Preamps and Instrumentation Amps

- **Mic Preamps:** Use low-noise, high CMRR (common mode rejection ratio) instrumentation amps (e.g., INA217, THAT1510).
- **Input Impedance:** High (1MΩ+) for instrument, 2kΩ for mic.
- **Gain Setting:** Switchable or programmable gain (relay, analog switch, or digital potentiometer).
- **Phantom Power:** +48V supplied through 6.8k resistors to XLR pins 2/3.
- **Power Supply:** Use split rails (±15V, ±12V) for maximum headroom.

## 28.15 Power Delivery, Protections, and Battery Integration

### 28.15.1 Power Tree, Sequencing, and Rail Management

- **Power Tree:** Map all voltage rails from input to all loads (CPU, RAM, analog, digital, IO).
- **Sequencing:** Some chips require rails to come up/down in order; use sequencer ICs or RC delays.

```

### 28.15.2 DC/DC Converters: Buck, Boost, Inverting, Isolated

- **Inverting:** Generate negative rails (e.g., -12V analog) from positive supply.
- **Isolated:** Needed for full galvanic isolation (e.g., USB, MIDI with full isolation).
- **Layout:** Keep switch node area small, use ground plane, minimize EMI.

### 28.15.3 Filtering, Ripple Rejection, and Audio Sensitivity
