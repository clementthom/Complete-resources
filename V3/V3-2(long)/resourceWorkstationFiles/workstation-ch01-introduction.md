## 1.1 What is the Workstation Project?

The Workstation project is a comprehensive, open-source platform that combines elements of digital audio workstation (DAW), advanced synthesizer, multieffects processor, and performance tool into a single, modular hardware/software ecosystem. Designed for both studio and live use, it leverages the power of a modern System on Chip (SoC)—such as the BCM283 family (Raspberry Pi)—and integrates analog and digital audio, MIDI, sequencers, networked control, and deep user programmability.

## 1.2 Philosophy and Goals

- **Modularity:** Each subsystem (synth, sequencer, effects, UI, patching) is modular, allowing deep customization.
- **Hybrid Signal Path:** Combines analog warmth and real-time control with the flexibility of digital processing and automation.
- **Open & Hackable:** All hardware designs, firmware, and software are open, documented, and extensible. Designed to support community mods.
- **Pro-Grade and Accessible:** Targeting both professional and advanced DIY users. Focus on robust I/O, performance, and reliability.
- **Integration:** Designed to be the center of a modern studio or live setup, connecting seamlessly to other gear—hardware and software.

## 1.3 Key Features

- Multi-engine digital synthesis (virtual analog, wavetable, FM, sampling, granular, etc.)
- High-resolution audio I/O (24-bit+, multiple channels)
- Analog VCA/VCF integration for classic tone sculpting
- Deep modulation matrix, flexible routing, polyphonic voice management
- Powerful sequencer with pattern, song, and automation modes
- MIDI and CV/Gate I/O, including USB, classic DIN, BLE, and advanced protocols (MPE, NRPN)
- Real-time effects: chorus, delay, reverb, distortion, modular FX chains
- Touch and tactile UI (encoders, pads, sliders, displays)
- Patch management, preset recall, and file-based storage
- Networking: OSC, remote control, web UI, collaboration
- Expandable hardware (shields, hats, USB peripherals)
- Runs on a modern Linux platform, optimized for real-time audio
