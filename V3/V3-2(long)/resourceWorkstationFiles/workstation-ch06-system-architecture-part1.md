## 6.1 Introduction: Why System Architecture Matters

System architecture is the “blueprint” that connects all parts of your workstation: hardware, firmware, drivers, operating system, audio engines, UI, storage, and networking.  
A well-architected system is easier to build, debug, expand, and maintain.  
This chapter is a **step-by-step, beginner-friendly, and exhaustive guide** to the theory and applied practice of modular architecture for large-scale embedded audio workstations.

## 6.2 What is a Modular System? (Beginner Orientation)

### 6.2.1 Definition

A **modular system** is built out of separate, self-contained parts (modules), each responsible for a piece of the whole.

### 6.2.2 Why Modular?

- Easier to upgrade (swap in new modules)
- Easier to debug (fault isolation)
- Enables parallel development
- Encourages reuse (same synth engine in multiple projects)
- Supports expansion (add new features without total redesign)

### 6.2.3 Examples in Audio

- Hardware: Separate boards for CPU, audio I/O, control surface, MIDI, analog, CV
- Software: Separate modules for sequencer, synths, effects, file system, UI

## 6.3 Hardware/Software Split: Definitions and Real-World Examples

### 6.3.1 What’s Hardware? What’s Software?

| Layer        | Hardware Example             | Software Example           |
|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Physical     | PCB, CPU, DAC, knobs        | (N/A)                      |
| Firmware     | Bootloader, I2C driver      | Audio driver, MIDI parser  |
| OS           | (N/A)                       | Linux, RTOS                |
| Middleware   | (N/A)                       | ALSA, JACK, audio routing  |
| Application  | (N/A)                       | Sequencer, sampler, UI     |

### 6.3.2 Where to Draw the Line?

- “Hardware/Software split” is the division of responsibility.
- Some features can be implemented in either (e.g., a filter in analog or DSP).

### 6.3.3 Real-World Examples

- **Classic:**  
  - Ensoniq Mirage: Digital sequencer, analog filter
  - Fairlight CMI: Separate CPU, voice cards, and digital/analog boards
- **Modern:**  
  - Elektron Digitakt: ARM CPU, Linux-based OS, tightly integrated hardware/software
  - DIY: Raspberry Pi as “brain,” Teensy for real-time I/O, analog filter PCB

## 6.4 Design Goals: Scalability, Maintainability, Testability, Performance

### 6.4.1 Scalability

- Can you add more tracks, voices, I/O, or effects without a full redesign?
- Modular buses, plugin architectures, and software APIs help scalability.

### 6.4.2 Maintainability

- Will you be able to fix bugs or upgrade parts years from now?
- Avoid monolithic “spaghetti” code/hardware.

### 6.4.3 Testability

- Can you test modules independently?
- Use simulators, hardware abstraction, and standard interfaces.

### 6.4.4 Performance

- Does the design meet real-time needs? (audio latency, UI response)
- Hardware/software split can move heavy DSP to hardware or optimize in code.

## 6.5 System Architecture Diagrams: How to Read and Draw Them

### 6.5.1 What is a System Diagram?

- A graphical overview of all modules and how they connect.

### 6.5.2 Common Diagram Types

| Type              | Purpose                          | Example Tools    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| Block Diagram     | Major modules and data flows     | draw.io, Lucidchart, pen & paper |
| Layer Diagram     | Shows abstraction layers         | Mermaid, Markdown ASCII art      |
| Sequence Diagram  | Step-by-step event flows         | Mermaid, UML tools               |
| State Diagram     | System states and transitions    | draw.io, yEd, pen & paper        |

### 6.5.3 Reading Example: Block Diagram

```plaintext
[UI] <--> [App Logic] <--> [Audio Engine] <--> [Audio I/O]
                       |
                   [Storage]
                       |
                  [MIDI/CV I/O]
```

### 6.5.4 Drawing Your Own

- Start with major modules (“CPU”, “Audio Board”, “UI Board”, “Power”).
- Draw arrows for information flow (audio, MIDI, control).
- Add notes: type of connection (I2C, USB, SPI, analog).
- Use different shapes for hardware (rectangles) and software (rounded boxes).

## 6.6 Layered Architecture: Hardware, Drivers, Middleware, Application, UI

### 6.6.1 Classic Layered Model

```plaintext
[User Interface]
        |
[Application Logic]
        |
[Middleware: Audio Routing, MIDI, Filesystem]
        |
[Drivers: ALSA, GPIO, I2C]
        |
[Hardware: CPU, DAC, ADC, Display]
```

### 6.6.2 Benefits

- Each layer only talks to the layer above/below.
- You can replace the UI or audio hardware without rewriting everything.

### 6.6.3 Layer Boundaries

- Define clear APIs at each layer boundary (e.g., audio driver API, UI event API).

---

## 6.7 The Data Flow: Signals, Events, Messages, and State

### 6.7.1 Types of Data Flow

| Type      | Example                                 | Notes                        |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Signal    | Audio stream, clock pulse, analog CV    | High bandwidth, real-time    |
| Event     | Button press, MIDI note, UI gesture     | Low bandwidth, async         |
| Message   | Patch load, file write, network packet  | Structured, can be queued    |
| State     | Patch memory, sequencer position        | Persistent or volatile       |

### 6.7.2 Real-World Example: Sequencer Note

1. User presses pad (event)
2. UI module sends event to app logic
3. App logic updates sequencer state
4. Audio engine receives event, triggers note
5. Audio out and/or sends MIDI/CV

### 6.7.3 Data Flow Diagrams

```plaintext
[Pad Press] --> [UI Event] --> [Sequencer Engine] --> [Audio Engine] --> [DAC]
```

### 6.7.4 Message Passing Patterns

- Use queues to decouple modules (ring buffers for audio/MIDI, OS message queues for UI/events).

---

## 6.8 Dependency Management: Decoupling, Interfaces, and Abstraction

### 6.8.1 Why Decouple?

- Reduces bugs, makes upgrades easier, enables parallel work.

### 6.8.2 Interfaces and APIs

- Define clear interfaces for each module (C header files, function tables, virtual classes).
- Don’t access module internals directly from outside.

### 6.8.3 Dependency Injection

- Pass dependencies explicitly (function pointers, structs, or callbacks).
- Enables unit testing and mocking.

### 6.8.4 Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

- Provides a consistent API for different hardware (e.g., `audio_out()`, `midi_send()`).

### 6.8.5 Example: Audio Driver Interface

```c
typedef struct {
    void (*init)(void);
    int  (*write)(const float* buf, int n);
    void (*close)(void);
} AudioDriverAPI;
```

- App code calls API, does not care about hardware details.

## 6.9 Case Studies: Classic Modular Audio Workstation Architectures

### 6.9.1 Fairlight CMI (1980s)

- Separate CPU, keyboard, display, voice cards, analog output boards.
- All connected via backplane.
- Modular software: sequencer, sampler, editor, OS shell.

### 6.9.2 Synclavier

- Modular voice cards (each with its own DSP and D/A).
- Real-time bus for control, separate bus for audio.

### 6.9.3 Emulator III

- Modular expansion: could add more RAM, sample channels, SCSI.
- Software separated into OS, sequencer, sampler, disk manager.

### 6.9.4 Modern DIY Example

- Raspberry Pi runs Linux, USB connects to Teensy for real-time I/O.
- Audio/CV expansion via I2S or SPI.
- Separate microcontroller for control surface (pads, encoders).
