## 3.48 Introduction to Audio Outputs

Audio outputs are how your workstation connects to the outside world—mixers, speakers, amplifiers, headphones, and recording gear.  
This chapter is a **step-by-step, beginner-friendly, and exhaustive guide** to designing, wiring, and troubleshooting all types of audio output.

We'll start with basic concepts and work through every detail:  
- What makes a good output?  
- How do you avoid noise, hum, and pops?  
- What connectors and amplifiers do you need for different types of gear?

## 3.49 Understanding Line Level, Headphone, and Speaker Outputs

### 3.49.1 What is Line Level?

- **Line level** is the standard voltage range for connecting audio gear (mixers, synths, audio interfaces).
- **Typical range:** ~0.316V RMS (consumer) to 1.23V RMS (pro).
- **Not designed for driving speakers or headphones directly.**

### 3.49.2 What is Headphone Output?

- Designed to drive headphones (16–600Ω).
- Needs more current and may need higher voltage swing than line out.
- Includes a small power amplifier.

### 3.49.3 What is Speaker Output?

- Drives small speakers directly, usually for monitoring or portable use.
- Needs a dedicated **power amplifier** (not just an op-amp).
- For larger speakers, use external amps.

### 3.49.4 Summary Table

| Output Type | Voltage (RMS) | Impedance (typical) | Needs Amplifier? | Use Case              |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Line        | 0.316–1.23V   | 10k–100kΩ           | Buffer only      | Mixers, recorders     |
| Headphone   | 0.5–2V        | 16–600Ω             | Yes (small amp)  | Headphones            |
| Speaker     | 1–10V+        | 4–16Ω               | Yes (power amp)  | Small speakers        |

## 3.50 Balanced vs. Unbalanced Audio Explained

### 3.50.1 Unbalanced Audio

- **Two wires:** Signal and ground.
- Prone to picking up noise over long cables.
- Used for short runs, consumer gear (1/8", RCA, some 1/4").

### 3.50.2 Balanced Audio

- **Three wires:** Hot, cold (inverted signal), and ground.
- Noise picked up equally on both signal wires cancels out at the destination.
- Used for pro gear, long cable runs, XLR, TRS ("stereo" 1/4" used as balanced).

### 3.50.3 Why Use Balanced Outputs?

- Rejects hum and interference, especially important in studios and live rigs.
- For home/DIY setups with short cables, unbalanced is usually fine.

### 3.50.4 How to Wire Balanced Outputs

- Use a **differential driver IC** (e.g., THAT1646, DRV134) or transformer.
- Connect hot and cold to output jack, ground to sleeve.

---

## 3.51 Line Output Circuits: Design and Implementation

### 3.51.1 Simple Line Output (Unbalanced)

**Parts Needed:**
- Op-amp buffer (TL072, NE5532, OPA2134)
- DC blocking capacitor (10–22uF, non-polarized)
- Series resistor (100–1kΩ for output protection)
- Optional: Zobel network (RC) for stability

**Wiring Steps:**
1. Audio signal from DAC/analog chain → op-amp buffer.
2. Output of buffer → series capacitor → output jack tip.
3. Output jack sleeve → ground.

### 3.51.2 Adding Output Muting ("Pop-Free")

- Use analog switch (e.g., MAX4053) or relay between op-amp and jack.
- Control with Pi GPIO: mute output at power-up/shutdown to avoid pops.

### 3.51.3 Stereo Output

- Use dual op-amp for left and right channels.
- Keep traces and wires symmetric for best stereo imaging.

---

## 3.52 Headphone Output: Drivers, Amplifiers, and Safety

### 3.52.1 Why a Dedicated Headphone Amp?

- Headphones need more current than line output provides.
- Too little power = weak bass, distortion, possible damage to op-amp.

### 3.52.2 Headphone Amplifier ICs

| IC         | Features                  | Pros             | Cons             |
|------------|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| TPA6132A2  | Stereo, low power, popless| Great for Pi HAT | Limited voltage  |
| NJM4556A   | High current, classic     | Used in O2 amp   | Needs dual supply|
| OPA2134    | Audiophile, can drive HP  | Clean sound      | Expensive        |
| LM4880     | Mono, basic, cheap        | Easy to use      | Not hi-fi        |

### 3.52.3 Headphone Output Circuit

**Parts Needed:**
- Headphone amp IC or op-amp with high current output
- Coupling caps (220–470uF, non-polarized)
- Output resistors (10–47Ω for safety, optional)

**Wiring Steps:**
1. Audio signal → headphone amp.
2. Output → series cap → headphone jack tip/ring.
3. Sleeve → ground.
4. Optional: Connect "detect" pin on jack to mute speakers when headphones plugged in.

### 3.52.4 Protecting Headphones

- Use series resistor to avoid overcurrent on short circuit.
- Add muting relay or soft-start to prevent "pop" when powering up.

### 3.52.5 Headphone Jack Types

- 1/4" (6.35mm): Pro gear, durable.
- 1/8" (3.5mm): Most consumer headphones.

### 3.53.3 Speaker Output Circuit

- Input audio → amplifier IC (stereo or mono)
- Output → speaker terminals (4–8Ω speakers)
- Use decoupling caps and ferrite beads for noise suppression.

### 3.53.4 Speaker Selection

- 2–3" full-range drivers for compact builds.
- 4–8Ω impedance, 3–10W power handling.
- Enclosure design affects sound—use sealed or ported box.

### 3.53.5 Safety

- Never connect speaker directly to DAC or op-amp output!
- Use proper amp; check voltage and current before connecting speakers.

## 3.56 Ground Loops and Hum: Causes and Fixes

### 3.56.1 What is a Ground Loop?

- Unwanted current between two pieces of gear causes hum/buzz.
- Usually happens when two devices share more than one ground path.

### 3.56.2 How to Fix Ground Loops

- Use balanced outputs/inputs whenever possible.
- Lift ground on one end (switch or transformer).
- Use isolating transformer (audio isolation transformer) in output path.
- Avoid daisy-chaining ground wires.

### 3.56.3 Diagnosing Hum

- Unplug each cable one-by-one; when hum stops, that's the problem link.
- Try plugging all gear into the same power outlet.

## 3.57 Level and Impedance Matching for External Gear

### 3.57.1 What is Impedance?

- Resistance to AC (audio) signals—measured in ohms (Ω).
- Output impedance should be much lower than input impedance.

### 3.57.2 Matching Levels

| Output Type | Output Level | Connects to...         | Notes                         |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Instrument  | ~0.1V       | Hi-Z input (1MΩ)       | Guitars, some pedals          |
| Line (cons) | 0.316V      | Line in (10kΩ+)        | Home audio, synths            |
| Line (pro)  | 1.23V       | Pro mixer (10kΩ+)      | Studio gear, balanced         |
| Speaker     | 1–10V+      | Speaker (4–16Ω)        | Never connect direct to line! |

### 3.57.3 Buffering

- Use a buffer op-amp between DAC and output to lower impedance.
- For long cables, use balanced output circuit.

### 3.57.4 Adapters

- Use proper adapters (TRS to XLR, etc.) for different gear.
- Never force a jack; always check compatibility.

---

## 3.58 Output Testing, Calibration, and Troubleshooting

### 3.58.1 Initial Testing

- Use an oscilloscope or audio interface to check for signal at output.
- Listen for hum, distortion, pops.

### 3.58.2 Level Setting

- Play a test tone (e.g., 1kHz sine wave).
- Adjust output level so it matches standard (line, headphone, etc.) using trimpots or software gain.

### 3.58.3 Troubleshooting

- **No output:** Check wiring, op-amp power, output relay/switch, mute logic.
- **Distortion:** Check for clipping, op-amp current limits, speaker impedance.
- **Hum/Buzz:** Check for ground loops, shielding, cable quality.
- **Pop/Click:** Add or adjust mute circuit, check power sequencing.

---

## 3.59 Best Practices for Reliable, Quiet Outputs

- Always buffer analog outputs with op-amps.
- Use high-quality caps (film for audio, low ESR electrolytic for power).
- Shield all analog output traces and connectors.
- Keep output jacks away from power supplies and digital circuits.
- Label all outputs clearly (Line Out, Phones, etc.).
- Test with multiple types of gear (headphones, mixer, powered monitors) before final assembly.
