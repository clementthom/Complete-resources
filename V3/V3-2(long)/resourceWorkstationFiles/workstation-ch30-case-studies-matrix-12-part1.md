## 30.58 Introduction: The Matrix-12’s Place in Synth History

The Oberheim Matrix-12, released in 1985, is renowned as the most programmable analog polysynth of its era.  
It introduced a digital modulation matrix that brought the flexibility of a modular synth into a programmable, polyphonic keyboard.  
With 12 individual analog voices, each a full synth, and a digital "matrix" for CV routing, it is a masterpiece of both analog and digital design.

- **12-voice polyphony**, each voice a full "module" (2 VCO, 2 env, 2 LFO, VCF, VCAs)
- **Matrix modulation**: 20+ sources, 30+ destinations, patchable like a modular
- **Digital control**: Microcontroller manages all analog parameters via multiplexed DACs
- **Split/layer**: Two-part multitimbrality, velocity and aftertouch routing, MIDI and CV integration
- **Legendary sound**: Curtis ICs, analog paths, flexible architecture
