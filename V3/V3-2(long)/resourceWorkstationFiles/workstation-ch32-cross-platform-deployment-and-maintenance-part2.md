## 32.200 Packaging and Distribution Strategies

### 32.200.1 Desktop (Linux, Windows, macOS) Application Packaging

- **Linux**:
  - `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu): Metadata in `DEBIAN/control`, install/uninstall scripts.
  - `.rpm` (Fedora/openSUSE): Spec files, dependency tracking.
  - AppImage: Portable, self-contained, FUSE-based, runs on most distros.
  - Flatpak, Snap: Sandboxed, cross-distro, good for user-space tools.
  - Best Practice: Bundle all non-system libraries, respect FHS, offer AppImage for max compatibility.
- **Windows**:
  - `.exe` and `.msi` installers: Use NSIS, Inno Setup, or WiX for GUI/scripted installation.
  - Chocolatey and Winget: Modern package managers for CLI installs.
  - Code signing via Authenticode for security warnings.
- **macOS**:
  - `.dmg` disk images: Drag-and-drop install, code-signed, notarized.
  - Homebrew: Package manager for CLI install.
  - Mac App Store: Sandboxed, strict review, automatic updates.
  - Universal binaries for ARM/Intel (Apple Silicon).
- **Cross-Platform**:
  - Use CMake, Meson, or Python scripts for packaging.
  - Automate builds using CI (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure Pipelines).
  - Consistent versioning, changelogs, and artifact naming.

### 32.200.2 Embedded Firmware Packaging

- **Bare Metal/MCU**:
  - Raw binary (`.bin`), Intel HEX, or Motorola S-record for flashing.
  - Vendor-specific formats (STM32 `.dfu`, NXP `.sb`, Espressif `.bin`+`.elf`).
  - Include metadata (version, CRC, date, board ID) in firmware image.
  - Bootloader must support image verification and rollback.
- **Embedded Linux**:
  - Root filesystem images (`.img`, SquashFS, ext4), kernel (`zImage`/`uImage`), DTB, and bootloader binaries.
  - Use manifest file (`manifest.json`, `fwinfo.yaml`) for upgrade system.
  - Partition and A/B update support for fail-safe upgrades.

### 32.200.3 Mobile and Web Deployment (Hybrid Instruments)

- **Mobile**:
  - Android: `.apk` (Google Play, direct sideload), `.aab` (Play Asset Delivery).
  - iOS: `.ipa` (App Store, TestFlight, ad hoc).
  - Use Cordova, React Native, or Flutter for hybrid UIs.
- **Web**:
  - WebAssembly for audio engines, JavaScript/TypeScript for UI.
  - Service workers for offline support, IndexedDB for persistent storage.
  - Use Progressive Web App (PWA) features for installability.

### 32.200.4 Plugin Formats and DAW Integration (VST, AU, LV2, AAX)

- **VST2/VST3**:
  - Cross-platform, C++ ABI, loaded by most DAWs.
  - Bundle as DLL (Windows), .so (Linux), .vst3 bundle (macOS).
  - Include `Info.plist` and manifest files.
- **AU (Audio Unit)**:
  - macOS only, CoreAudio-based, bundle as .component.
  - Sandbox and entitlements required for App Store.
- **LV2**:
  - Open standard, Linux-first, extensible metadata (Turtle/RDF).
- **AAX**:
  - Pro Tools format, requires SDK and developer agreement.
- **Plugin Installers**:
  - Custom installer (NSIS, Inno), or cross-platform (Juice Installer, Pkgbuild).
  - Install to correct system/user directories, handle plugin cache regeneration.

## 32.201 Update and Delivery Mechanisms

### 32.201.1 Firmware Over-the-Air (OTA), USB, SD, and Network Updates

- **OTA Update**:
  - Embedded Linux: Use swupdate, Mender, RAUC, or custom scripts.
  - Bare Metal: HTTP, MQTT, or FTP download, written to secondary flash bank.
  - Secure: Signed images, version checks, CRC or hash verification.
  - Rollback: Bootloader support for fallback to previous image if update fails.
- **USB Update**:
  - Mass storage device auto-mount, scan for firmware file, verify and flash.
  - User feedback via LED, screen, or web UI.
- **SD Card Update**:
  - Place firmware file on SD, detected at boot or via menu.
  - Log update result to file for diagnostics.
- **Network Update**:
  - HTTP(S), SFTP, or custom protocol.
  - Can be triggered by user or scheduled.

### 32.201.2 Desktop Updaters: Installers, Patchers, and App Store Distribution

- **Installers**:
  - Download and install new version, migrate user data, uninstall previous version.
  - Support silent installs for enterprise.
- **In-app Updaters**:
  - Check for updates at launch or on demand.
  - Use HTTPS for update checks, digital signatures for packages.
  - Apply binary patches (e.g., bsdiff) for smaller downloads.
- **App Stores**:
  - Automatic update via platform store (Windows Store, Mac App Store, Linux Flatpak/Snap).
  - Must pass security/notarization checks.

### 32.201.3 Plugin Update Workflows

- **Manual Update**:
  - User downloads installer/package for new plugin version.
- **In-Host Update**:
  - Plugin queries update server, downloads, and installs update.
  - Rescan plugin folders on next DAW launch.
- **Plugin Manager Apps**:
  - Centralized tool for updating, activating, and managing plugins.
  - Handles version compatibility, dependency checks.

### 32.201.4 Rollback, Recovery, and A/B Partitioning

- **A/B Partitioning**:
  - Two root partitions; update inactive one and switch boot flag only if verified.
- **Rollback**:
  - Bootloader or firmware detects failed boot, reverts to previous image.
- **Recovery Modes**:
  - User-invoked (button/menu), automatic after repeated crash/failure.
  - Minimal shell/diagnostic app for repair or re-flash.

## 32.202 Maintenance, Diagnostics, and Support

### 32.202.1 Health Monitoring, Logging, and Crash Reporting

- **Health Monitoring**:
  - Monitor CPU, RAM, disk, battery, temperature, and audio/MIDI buffer states.
  - Log critical events (overruns, underruns, temperature spikes, failed updates).
- **Logging**:
  - Local: ringbuffer, syslog, persistent file.
  - Remote: send logs via HTTP, MQTT, SFTP, or email.
  - Log rotation: compress and archive old logs, limit file size.
- **Crash Reporting**:
  - Desktop: Minidump, core dump, or stacktrace upload.
  - Embedded: Store last crash in flash/EEPROM, upload on next boot.
  - Include firmware version, config, and recent log tail.

### 32.202.2 Remote Diagnostics, Telemetry, and Field Support

- **Remote Diagnostics**:
  - SSH for Linux, serial console for embedded, custom web UI for user support.
  - Secure access with key or one-time token.
- **Telemetry**:
  - Periodic stats upload (opt-in): device health, usage metrics, error counts.
  - Privacy: anonymize, user-consent, data minimization.
- **Field Support**:
  - Bundle diagnostics tool for user to run and send results.
  - Automated email/ticket creation with logs and system info.

### 32.202.3 User Data Migration, Backup, and Restore

- **Migration**:

  - Always backup before migration; keep rollback path.
- **Backup**:
  - Cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive), SD/USB, or local encrypted archive.
  - Scheduled or on-demand; user-controlled retention.
- **Restore**:
  - Selective or full restore; verify integrity after restore.
