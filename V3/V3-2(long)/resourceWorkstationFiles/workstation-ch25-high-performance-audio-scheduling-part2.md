## 25.9 Multi-Core and Parallel Audio Processing

### 25.9.1 Why Parallelism? Modern CPU and DSP Architectures

- **Multi-Core CPUs:** Most modern chips (desktop, mobile, embedded) have 2–16+ real cores, often with hyperthreading/SMT.
- **DSPs:** Many embedded workstations use multi-core DSPs (SHARC, Blackfin, ARM with NEON).
- **Opportunity:** Parallelize independent work: voices, tracks, FX, busses.
- **Goal:** Use all available CPU to reduce buffer time and increase polyphony.

#### 25.9.1.1 Example: Voice Parallelism

- 64 synth voices, each can be synthesized independently in parallel for each block.

### 25.9.2 Task Decomposition: Voices, FX, and Busses

- **Voice Parallelism:** Split N voices across M cores; each thread processes a batch of voices.
- **FX Parallelism:** Process independent FX (e.g., insert FX per channel) in parallel.
- **Bus/Stem Parallelism:** Parallelize across independent busses or groups.
- **Limitations:** Some FX must be processed in a specific order (serial, due to feedback/routing).

#### 25.9.2.1 Diagram: Threaded Voice Processing

```
[Voice 1] ---\
[Voice 2] ----\
...             > Thread Pool --> Mixer
[Voice N] ----/
```

### 25.9.3 Work Stealing, Thread Pools, and Task Queues

- **Thread Pool:** Fixed set of worker threads launched at startup; tasks dispatched each audio block.
- **Work Stealing:** Idle threads “steal” tasks from others to balance load.
- **Task Queues:** Lock-free or minimal lock queues per thread for submitting work.

#### 25.9.3.1 Example: Thread Pool (C++ Pseudocode)

```cpp
std::vector<std::thread> pool;
std::queue<Task> task_queue;
while (running) {
  Task t = task_queue.pop();
  t.execute();
}
```

### 25.9.4 Load Balancing and Affinity

- **Static Partitioning:** Fixed mapping (e.g., voices 0–15 = thread 1, 16–31 = thread 2).
- **Dynamic Load Balancing:** Assign tasks based on current CPU load, voice activity.
- **Thread Affinity:** Pin DSP threads to cores for cache locality and reduced context switching.

### 25.9.5 Real-Time Safe Parallelism Patterns

- **Barrier Synchronization:** All threads must finish voice processing before mixer runs.
- **Double Buffering:** Prevents data races; output of one block is input to next.
- **Lock-Free Data Sharing:** Use atomic flags/counters or spinlocks—no blocking allowed in audio thread.

### 25.9.6 NUMA and Cache Coherency Issues

- **NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access):** Memory may be “closer” to some CPU cores; avoid cross-node access for audio buffers.
- **Cache Coherency:** Hot data (e.g., global mixer buffers) may “bounce” between CPU caches, slowing down; prefer per-thread buffers, minimize sharing.

## 25.10 Plugin Hosting and Scheduling Strategies

### 25.10.1 Plugin Graphs: VST, AU, LV2, Internal FX

- **Plugin Graph:** Plugins (FX, instruments) are nodes; audio/MIDI flow along edges.
- **Supported Standards:** VST2/3, AudioUnit, LV2, CLAP, custom APIs.
- **Graph Scheduling:** Plugins with no dependencies can be processed in parallel.

### 25.10.2 Real-Time Plugin Instantiation and Destruction

- **Pre-Instantiation:** Allocate plugin objects at load time, not during audio callback.
- **Safe Destruction:** Defer plugin unload to non-audio thread.
- **Hot Swap:** Crossfade or buffer plugin state to avoid dropouts during insert/remove.

### 25.10.3 Sandboxing, Isolation, and Failure Containment

- **Plugin Sandboxing:** Run third-party plugins in isolated process; crash does not bring down engine.
- **IPC (Inter-Process Communication):** Audio and control data passed between engine and sandbox.
- **Timeouts:** Kill/disable plugin if it fails to process block in time.

### 25.10.4 Parameter Automation and Inter-Plugin Communication

- **Automation:** Host passes parameter changes to plugin with timestamp/block alignment.
- **Inter-Plugin Modulation:** Plugins can modulate each other (e.g., sidechain, MIDI routing) via host.
- **Sample Accuracy:** Some hosts support sample-accurate parameter automation.

### 25.10.5 Latency Compensation and Synchronization

- **Plugin Latency:** Some plugins (e.g., lookahead limiter, convolution reverb) introduce delay.
- **Automatic Compensation:** Host delays other audio paths to keep everything in sync.
- **Reporting:** Plugins must report their latency to host.

## 25.11 Real-World Lock-Free Queues and Audio Callback Code

### 25.11.1 Reference Ring Buffer Implementations (C/C++)

#### 25.11.1.1 SPSC Ring Buffer (C)

```c
typedef struct {
  int head, tail, size;
  float *data;
} RingBuffer;

// Producer (UI thread)
void rb_push(RingBuffer* rb, float val) {
  int next = (rb->head + 1) % rb->size;
  if (next != rb->tail) { rb->data[rb->head] = val; rb->head = next; }
}
// Consumer (audio thread)
float rb_pop(RingBuffer* rb) {
  if (rb->tail == rb->head) return 0.0f; // empty
  float val = rb->data[rb->tail];
  rb->tail = (rb->tail + 1) % rb->size;
  return val;
}
```

### 25.11.2 Lock-Free Message Passing for MIDI and Events

- **MIDI Events:** Queue incoming events from hardware/UI to audio thread.
- **Message Types:** Note on/off, CC, pitchbend, program, automation, custom events.
- **Atomic Event Struct:** Use atomic flags/counters for SPSC, MPMC for complex routing.

#### 25.11.2.1 Example: MIDI Event Queue (Pseudo)

```c
typedef struct { int type, data1, data2, timestamp; } MidiEvent;
MidiEvent midi_queue[MAX_EVENTS];
volatile int midi_head, midi_tail;
// Push on MIDI/UI thread, pop on audio thread
```

### 25.11.3 Audio Callback Templates and Boilerplate for All Platforms

#### 25.11.3.1 ALSA (Linux) Audio Callback

```c
void audio_callback(float* out, int frames) {
  for (int i = 0; i < frames; ++i)
    out[i] = synth_next_sample();
}
```

#### 25.11.3.2 Core Audio (macOS/iOS) Render Callback

```c
OSStatus render_cb(void* inRef, AudioUnitRenderActionFlags* flags,
                   const AudioTimeStamp* ts, UInt32 bus, UInt32 nFrames,
                   AudioBufferList* ioData) {
  // Fill ioData->mBuffers with audio
  return noErr;
}
```

#### 25.11.3.3 ASIO (Windows) Process Callback

```c
void processAudio(float** outputs, long numSamples) {
  for (int ch = 0; ch < numChannels; ++ch)
    for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i)
      outputs[ch][i] = process_channel(ch, i);
}
```

### 25.11.4 Live Parameter Push and Smoothing

- **Atomic Push:** UI thread writes to atomic variable; audio thread reads and interpolates.
- **Smoothing:** Apply low-pass filter to avoid parameter “zipper” noise.

#### 25.11.4.1 Smoothing Example

```c
float smooth(float last, float target, float coeff) {
  return last + coeff * (target - last);
}
```

## 25.12 Diagnostics, Profiling, and Tuning

### 25.12.1 Buffer Overrun/Underrun Detection and Logging

- **Overrun:** Audio engine can’t fill output buffer in time; driver reports “XRUN.”
- **Logging:** Timestamp, buffer size, thread load, CPU utilization.
- **Recovery:** Optional—drop buffer, fill with silence, attempt to catch up.

### 25.12.2 DSP CPU Profiling (Per-Voice/Per-Block)

- **Per-Block Timing:** Measure time to process each audio block (start-stop timer).
- **Per-Voice/Track Timing:** Attribute CPU load to each voice, FX, plugin.
- **Thresholds:** Alert/log if block time exceeds safe margin (< buffer duration).

### 25.12.3 Latency and Jitter Measurement

- **Roundtrip Latency:** Inject signal, measure time to output.
- **Jitter:** Stddev or histogram of block processing times.
- **Tools:** JACK “latency”, Windows DPC latency checker, custom trace points.

### 25.12.4 Real-Time Logging and Visualization Tools

- **Real-Time Monitor:** Live display of CPU, block time, buffer status, XRUNs.
- **Logging:** Ring buffer of recent events, dump to file on error.
- **Visualization:** Graphs of buffer fill, latency over time, per-thread load.

### 25.12.5 Automated Stress Testing and Regression

- **Automation:** Scripted test runs with max voices, FX, rapid patch changes.
- **Regression:** Compare new engine builds to golden/reference output under load.
- **Edge Cases:** Underflow, overflow, memory leak, thread starvation, lock contention.

## 25.13 Failure Recovery and Robustness Strategies

### 25.13.1 Dropout Handling, Graceful Degradation, and Recovery

- **Dropout Recovery:** Fill buffer with silence, log, attempt to recover next block.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Reduce polyphony, bypass heavy FX, or increase buffer size if overload detected.
- **User Notification:** Popup or log entry to alert user of performance issue.

### 25.13.2 Watchdog Timers and Emergency Reset

- **Watchdog:** Timer checks audio callback duration; triggers reset if deadline missed.
- **Emergency Reset:** Restart audio engine, reload state, attempt to resume with minimal interruption.

### 25.13.3 Hot-Swap and Seamless Engine Restart

- **Hot-Swap:** Swap DSP/engine code without stopping audio (e.g., crossfade, buffer handover).
- **State Preservation:** Save/restore engine state to RAM/disk for fast restart.
- **Automated Recovery:** System attempts restart on crash, logs details for developer.

### 25.13.4 Persistent State and Auto-Save for Audio Engines

- **Auto-Save:** Periodically save project/patch state to disk to prevent data loss.
- **Persistent Buffers:** Use non-volatile RAM or fast disk for critical audio buffers.
- **Crash Recovery:** On restart, offer to reload last good state.

### 25.13.5 User Feedback, Notification, and Logging

- **Feedback:** Clear, actionable error messages (“Audio buffer underrun at 2:34, 64 voices active.”)
- **Logging:** Timestamped logs of all errors, warnings, and recoveries.
- **Export:** Allow user to export logs for support/developer diagnosis.

- [ ] Use lock-free queues, atomics for thread communication
- [ ] Profile and log all buffer overruns/underruns
- [ ] Provide actionable error messages and logs to users
- [ ] Test on all target platforms, at minimum and maximum buffer sizes
- [ ] Document engine state and hot-swap procedures
- [ ] Always auto-save and persist user data for recovery
