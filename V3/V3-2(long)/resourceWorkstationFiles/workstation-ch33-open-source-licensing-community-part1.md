## 33.100 Introduction and Rationale

Open source is transformative for the development of music workstations, synthesizers, and creative audio software. It powers ecosystems from Linux audio to VCV Rack, enables rapid innovation, and lowers the barrier for new entrants. This chapter provides a deep dive into open source models, license selection and compliance, and community building for musical technology, focusing on practical strategies and real-world case studies.

## 33.101 Open Source Models in Audio Workstations

### 33.101.1 Definitions: FOSS, FLOSS, OSS, Copyleft, Permissive

- **FOSS**: Free and Open Source Software; emphasizes both freedom (as in speech) and openness of code.
- **FLOSS**: Free/Libre and Open Source Software; stresses liberty, not price.
- **OSS**: Open Source Software; source code is available under an OSI-approved license.
- **Copyleft**: License mechanism requiring derivatives to remain under the same license (e.g., GPL).
- **Permissive**: License allows proprietary derivatives (e.g., MIT, BSD, Apache).

### 33.101.2 Historical Examples: Ardour, LMMS, ZynAddSubFX, OpenMusic, VCV Rack

- **Ardour**: DAW under GPL, uses dual licensing for commercial plugins.
- **LMMS**: GPLv2+, large community of contributors, extensive plugin system.
- **ZynAddSubFX**: Synthesizer, originally GPL, now with commercial forks (Zyn-Fusion).
- **OpenMusic**: Academic/algorithmic composition, LGPL.
- **VCV Rack**: GPLv3 core, paid plugins; thriving open+commercial ecosystem.

### 33.101.3 Commercialization of Open Source Audio

- **Service-based**: Support, training, integration (e.g., Harrison Mixbus on Ardour).
- **Dual licensing**: Open core + paid proprietary extensions.
- **Donations/Crowdfunding**: Patreon, OpenCollective, GitHub Sponsors.
- **Paid plugins, content, or hardware**: Open platform with commercial add-ons (VCV, Zynthian).

### 33.101.4 Hybrid Models: Core OSS, Proprietary Plugins/Extensions

- **Plugin SDKs**: Public, but plugins can be open or closed source (LV2, VST3, etc.).
- **App architecture**: Open main app, closed-source UI, DSP, or content packs.
- **License boundaries**: Use dynamic linking or IPC to isolate copyleft/closed code.

## 33.102 Choosing the Right License

### 33.102.1 License Families: GPL, LGPL, AGPL, MIT, BSD, Apache, MPL, EUPL, Proprietary

| License   | Copyleft | Linking | Patents | Commercial | Notes |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|------------|-------|
| GPLv3     | Strong   | No      | Yes     | No         | Viral to all derivatives |
| LGPL      | Weak     | Yes     | Yes     | Yes        | Library exception        |
| AGPL      | Network  | No      | Yes     | No         | Web/remote copyleft      |
| MIT       | No       | Yes     | No      | Yes        | Simple, permissive       |
| BSD       | No       | Yes     | No      | Yes        | 2-clause/3-clause        |
| Apache 2  | No       | Yes     | Yes     | Yes        | Explicit patent grant    |
| MPL       | File     | Yes     | Yes     | Yes        | File-based, weak copyleft|
| EUPL      | Strong   | Yes     | Yes     | Yes        | EU law-based, compatible |
| Proprietary | No     | No      | Varies  | Yes        | Closed source            |

### 33.102.2 Copyleft vs. Permissive: Pros, Cons, and Use Cases

- **Copyleft (GPL/AGPL/LGPL/MPL)**:
  - **Pros**: Ensures code (and derivatives) remain open, encourages community contributions, prevents “embrace and extend” by closed vendors.
  - **Cons**: Restricts commercial/proprietary use, can limit adoption in mixed-license environments, license incompatibility risks.
  - **Use Cases**: Core infrastructure, DAWs, synth engines, libraries needing community stewardship.

- **Permissive (MIT/BSD/Apache)**:
  - **Pros**: Maximizes adoption, allows proprietary/commercial integration, simpler compliance.
  - **Cons**: “Code mining” by closed vendors, fewer contributions back, risk of fragmentation.
  - **Use Cases**: SDKs, plugins, utility libraries, educational projects.

### 33.102.3 License Compatibility: Linking, Derivatives, Dual Licensing

- **Linking**:  
  - Static linking to GPL code = whole app must be GPL.
  - Dynamic linking to LGPL/MIT/BSD is allowed in proprietary apps.
  - Plugin architectures often use dynamic linking to avoid viral copyleft.
- **Dual Licensing**:  
  - Offer code under two licenses (e.g., GPL for community, commercial for private use).
- **Derivative works**:  
  - If you modify GPL code, your version must also be GPL.
  - MIT/BSD/Apache allow closed derivatives (with attribution).

### 33.102.4 Patents, Trademarks, and Contributor Agreements

- **Patents**:  
  - Apache 2, GPLv3, MPL include patent grants.
  - Be cautious of including patented algorithms, especially in audio DSP (e.g., MP3, AAC, etc.).
- **Trademarks**:  
  - License usually does not grant name/logo rights—register and enforce separately.
- **Contributor Agreements**:  
  - CLA: Contributor License Agreement—explicit permission for project to use/modify contributions.
  - DCO: Developer Certificate of Origin—signed-off-by in commits, simpler and less legal overhead.

### 33.102.5 SPDX, REUSE, and License Metadata

- **SPDX**:  
  - Standardized license identifiers for files/projects (e.g., `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`).
- **REUSE**:  
  - REUSE.software: project-wide license compliance, machine-readable metadata.
- **License scanners**:  
  - FOSSology, ScanCode, Licensee, GitHub’s license detection.

## 33.103 Legal and Compliance Considerations

### 33.103.1 Copyright, Authorship, and Moral Rights

- **Copyright**:  
  - Protects code, documentation, graphics, sound samples, firmware.
- **Authorship**:  
  - Contributors retain copyright unless assigned.
  - Use copyright headers and commit metadata.
- **Moral rights**:  
  - Right to attribution, integrity—cannot always be waived (varies by jurisdiction).

### 33.103.2 Contributor License Agreements (CLA), Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

- **CLA**:  
  - Written agreement (often signed digitally), sometimes required by foundations or commercial sponsors.
  - May require assignment of copyright, patent rights.
- **DCO**:  
  - Simple “Signed-off-by” in commit messages.
  - Common in Linux kernel, avoids legal paperwork, but still binds contributor legally.

### 33.103.3 Third-Party Code Audits and License Scanning

- **Automated scanning**:  
  - Use tools (FOSSology, ScanCode Toolkit, LicenseFinder, GitHub Advanced Security) to detect incompatible licenses.
- **Manual review**:  
  - Required for bundled code, proprietary SDKs, or unclear license status.
- **Dependency management**:  
  - Pin versions, audit third-party updates for license changes.

### 33.103.4 Export Control, Encryption, and International Law

- **Export restrictions**:  
  - Some DSP/crypto code may be subject to US/EU export laws (e.g., strong encryption, military tech).
- **Compliance**:  
  - Provide ECCN numbers if required, document export status in README or docs.
- **Jurisdiction**:  
  - Hosting, contributors, and users may be in different legal contexts.

### 33.103.5 Compliance Automation and Reporting

- **CI integration**:  
  - Run license checks, SPDX validation, and REUSE lint as part of automated tests.
- **Reporting**:  
  - Generate SBOM (software bill of materials) for releases.
- **Badges**:  
  - Show license compliance/pass status in README.

## 33.104 Building and Sustaining a Community

### 33.104.1 Community Roles: Maintainers, Contributors, Users, Sponsors

- **Maintainers**:  
  - Own project vision, merge PRs, triage issues, set roadmap, enforce code of conduct.
- **Contributors**:  
  - Submit code, docs, translations, bug reports, answer questions, review PRs.
- **Users**:  
  - Report bugs, request features, join forums, provide feedback.
- **Sponsors**:  
  - Individuals, companies, or foundations funding development or infrastructure.

### 33.104.2 Governance Models: BDFL, Meritocracy, Foundations, Committees

| Model         | Pros                             | Cons                               | Example Projects     |
|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|
| BDFL          | Clear vision, fast decisions     | Risk of single point of failure    | Python (Guido), Linux (Linus) |
| Meritocracy   | Distributed authority, engagement| Can become cliquish, slow change   | Apache, KDE         |
| Foundations   | Long-term stewardship, funding   | Bureaucratic, slow decisions       | GNOME, Mozilla      |
| Committees    | Consensus, balanced input        | Risk of gridlock                   | Debian, W3C         |

### 33.104.3 Codes of Conduct and Community Guidelines

- **Purpose**:  
  - Create safe, inclusive, and productive environments.
