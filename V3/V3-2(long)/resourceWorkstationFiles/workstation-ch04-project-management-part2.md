## 4.13 Introduction: Leveling Up Your Project Management

This part builds on the basics to help you run bigger projects, work with contributors, automate repetitive tasks, and ensure your workstation project is robust, maintainable, and future-proof.  
It is written for **beginners**, with every term and process explained step-by-step.

---

## 4.14 Collaboration in Practice: Pull Requests, Reviews, and Branching Strategies

### 4.14.1 Pull Requests (PRs)

- A “pull request” asks to merge your changes into the main project.
- PRs allow team members to review, comment, and suggest improvements.
- On GitHub: Create a branch, push changes, then open a PR (“Compare & pull request”).

### 4.14.2 Why Use PRs?

- Prevents mistakes from going straight to main codebase.
- Encourages discussion and feedback.
- Enables code review and automated checks (CI).

### 4.14.3 Branching Strategies

| Strategy         | Description                              | Beginner Use? |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Feature Branch   | One branch per feature/fix. Merge when done. | Yes           |
| Git Flow         | Develop, master, release, hotfix branches.   | Maybe (advanced)|
| Trunk-Based      | Everyone works on short-lived branches off main. | Yes           |

**Recommended:**  
- Use feature branches for each task or bugfix (e.g., `feature/sequencer-ui`).
- Merge to `main` or `develop` after review.

### 4.14.4 Keeping Branches Up-to-Date

- Regularly pull changes from `main` (`git pull origin main`) to stay in sync.
- Resolve conflicts as they arise.

---

## 4.15 Code and Hardware Review: Why and How

### 4.15.1 What Is a Code Review?

- A second (or third) person checks your code before it’s merged.
- Catches bugs, improves code quality, and spreads knowledge.

### 4.15.2 Hardware Review

- Schematic and layout reviewed for errors, best practices, manufacturability.
- Check for missing decoupling caps, incorrect footprints, unconnected nets.

### 4.15.3 Review Checklist

| Item                      | Why It Matters                    |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Clear, readable code/docs | Others can understand and help    |
| Comments for complex code | Aids future maintenance           |
| Tests pass                | Prevents breaking the build       |
| Follows style guide       | Consistency                       |
| No secrets or passwords   | Security                          |
| Small, focused PRs        | Easier to review and merge        |

### 4.15.4 Review Tools

- GitHub’s built-in review and “suggested change” features.
- KiCad’s PCB diff and annotation tools.
- Markdown comments on schematics and diagrams.

---

## 4.16 Continuous Integration (CI): What It Is and Why You Need It

### 4.16.1 CI Basics

- CI = Continuous Integration: automated process that checks your code every time you push.
- Prevents “it works on my machine” issues.
- Runs tests, builds firmware, checks documentation, and can even deploy releases.

### 4.16.2 Why Use CI?

- Saves time by catching problems early.
- Ensures every commit/PR is tested the same way.
- Required for many open source and pro projects.

---

## 4.17 Setting Up CI on GitHub: Actions, Workflows, and Examples

### 4.17.1 GitHub Actions

- Free for public repos; easy to start.
- YAML-based workflow files define your build/test steps.

### 4.17.2 Creating Your First Workflow

1. In your repo, create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
2. Example (Python + Markdown lint):

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
      - name: Lint Markdown
        uses: actionshub/markdownlint@v3
```

### 4.17.3 Hardware Projects

- Run DRC/ERC checks on KiCad files with [kicad-action](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad-action).
- Use [pcb-rnd](https://repo.hu/projects/pcb-rnd/) for Gerber verification.
- For embedded code, use cross-compilers and test on QEMU or hardware-in-the-loop.

---

## 4.18 Automated Testing: Software, Hardware-in-the-Loop, and Manual Steps

### 4.18.1 Software Testing

- **Unit tests:** Check small parts (functions, modules) with known inputs/outputs.
- **Integration tests:** Multiple modules working together.
- **End-to-end (E2E) tests:** Simulate whole workflows.

### 4.18.2 Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) Testing

- Run firmware on target hardware, collect results (via UART, GPIO, or logs).
- Use test jigs (special boards with relays/switches) for repeatable hardware tests.

### 4.18.3 Manual QA

- Step-by-step test plans (see previous chapters).
- Log results for traceability and bug tracking.

---

## 4.19 Release Management: Versioning, Changelogs, and Tagging

### 4.19.1 Versioning

- Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., 1.2.3)
- Increase:
  - MAJOR for incompatible changes
  - MINOR for new features
  - PATCH for bug fixes

### 4.19.2 Changelogs

- Track what changed in each version.
- Use [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format or GitHub releases.

### 4.19.3 Tagging Releases

- Tag commits with `v1.0.0`, etc.:  
  ```bash
  git tag v1.0.0
  git push --tags
  ```
- Releases on GitHub can bundle binaries, docs, or production files.

---

## 4.20 Advanced Documentation: Wikis, Static Sites, and User Guides

### 4.20.1 Wikis

- GitHub provides a built-in wiki per repo.
- Good for collaborative, evolving docs.

### 4.20.2 Static Sites

- Tools like [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) can turn Markdown docs into a searchable website.
- Host for free with GitHub Pages.

### 4.20.3 User and Service Manuals

- Step-by-step guides with screenshots, diagrams, and troubleshooting.
- Include a section for field repairs and updates.

### 4.20.4 API and Code Docs

- Use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) for Python, [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) for C/C++.
- Auto-generate docs from code comments.
