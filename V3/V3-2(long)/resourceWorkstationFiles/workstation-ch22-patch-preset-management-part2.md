## 22.7 Tagging, Search, and Organization

### 22.7.1 Tagging Systems: Manual, Auto, and Inheritance

- **Manual Tagging:** Users assign tags to patches (genre, mood, instrument, author, usage).
- **Auto Tagging:** System detects properties (e.g., “sine”, “pad”, “percussive”, “FM”), suggests or applies tags on import.
- **Inheritance:** Tags propagate from parent (bank/library/project) to child patches unless overridden.
- **Tag Types:** Open (free text), closed (predefined list), or hybrid.
- **Multi-Language Tags:** Tag synonyms, translation, and user localization.

#### 22.7.1.1 Example: Tag Structure (JSON)

```json
{
  "tags": ["pad", "warm", "analog", "ambient"],
  "author": "Alice",
  "origin": "UserBank1"
}
```

### 22.7.2 Search Algorithms: Fuzzy, Filtered, Ranked

- **Fuzzy Search:** Tolerates typos and partial matches (“pad” finds “pads”, “padd”).
- **Filtered Search:** Combine tag filters, ranges (date, rating), and full-text search.
- **Ranking:** Sort results by match score, last used, rating, or user preference.
- **Indexing:** Build in-memory or DB index for instant search and recall.

#### 22.7.2.1 Example: Fuzzy Search (Python using FuzzyWuzzy)

```python
from fuzzywuzzy import process
results = process.extract("pad", patch_names, limit=10)
```

### 22.7.3 Patch Organization: Folders, Virtual Banks, Smart Collections

- **Folders:** Hierarchical, user-defined, mirrors filesystem or virtual.
- **Virtual Banks:** Tag-based dynamic groups (e.g., all “bass” patches).
- **Smart Collections:** Auto-populated based on rules (e.g., all patches rated 5 stars and tagged “live”).
- **Cross-Project Linking:** Patches can belong to multiple collections.

### 22.7.4 Bulk Tagging, Batch Rename, and Mass-Edit Tools

- **Bulk Tagging:** Select multiple patches, apply tags/edit metadata at once.
- **Batch Rename:** Regex or pattern-based renaming (“Bass_###”, “Lead_YYYYMMDD”).
- **Mass Edit:** Multi-select and edit author, comments, tags, ratings in one action.
- **Undo/Redo:** All bulk actions should be undoable.

### 22.7.5 Patch Browsing UX: Fast Preview, Filter, and Sort

- **Preview:** Instant audition (no full load), visual waveform/parameter preview.
- **Filter:** UI for tag, type, date, rating, user, favorites.
- **Sort:** Alphabetical, by date, by last used, by rating, by custom order.
- **Performance:** No lag with 10,000+ patches; lazy loading and paged UI.

### 22.7.6 Patch Locking, Favorites, and Personal Collections

- **Locking:** Mark as “do not edit/overwrite”; UI visual lock indicator.
- **Favorites:** Star or pin patches for quick access; per-user favorites.
- **Personal Collections:** Each user/profile has their own virtual banks, favorites, and lock states.
