## 21.15 Overview: Legacy Disk Workstation Storage in Modern Context

Many classic samplers and workstations (Emu Emax, Emulator III, Akai S900, Roland S-50, etc.) loaded their operating system and data (samples, patches, sequences) from floppy disks or hard disks into RAM at boot or on demand.  
Modern SD cards are ideal replacements for these mechanical media, offering much higher speed, capacity, and reliability, while preserving the classic workflow.

**Key Principles:**
- OS and sound data are not executed or streamed from SD card—they are loaded into RAM at boot or on user command, just like on the Emax or Emulator III.
- The SD card acts as a “virtual floppy” or “virtual SCSI hard drive,” with banks/sets selectable by the user and loaded wholesale into RAM.
- This approach results in fast, deterministic access to data during live performance (no mid-playback disk streaming), at the cost of requiring enough RAM for the largest data sets.

---

## 21.16 SD Card as Modern Floppy/HD Replacement

### 21.16.1 Why SD? Advantages and Design Constraints

- **High Capacity:** 32GB–1TB per card, far beyond any legacy floppy or SCSI disk.
- **Speed:** Even basic SD cards are thousands of times faster than floppy, and much faster than 1980s/90s HDDs.
- **Random-Access:** Seek times are negligible; supports instant load of OS/data blocks.
- **Reliability:** No moving parts, shock/vibration immune, wear-leveled.
- **Portability:** Easy to swap, duplicate, and archive.
- **Drawbacks:** Flash wear if OS/data is rewritten frequently; limited write cycles compared to RAM.

### 21.16.2 SD Card Types, Performance, and Endurance for OS/Data Use

- **Recommended Types:** Industrial SD for high-endurance, or reputable brand UHS-I for general use.
- **Performance:** 10–40 MB/s is more than enough for OS/data bulk loads; higher for fast boot.
- **Endurance:** Avoid cheap/no-name cards; check for wear leveling and power loss protection.
- **File System:** FAT32 or exFAT—universally supported and easy to maintain, unless security or longevity demand ext4/F2FS on embedded Linux.

### 21.16.3 SD Card Filesystem Layout for Emax/Emu III-Style Workstations

- **Partition Scheme:** Single partition is typical (FAT32/exFAT), but dual partitions (one for OS, one for data) can help separation.
- **Folder Layout Example:**

```
/OS/
  os.img
  bootloader.bin
/DATA/
  /Banks/
    Bank1/
      samples/
      patches/
      sequences/
    Bank2/
      ...
  /Projects/
    MySong/
      ...
/BACKUP/
  ...
```

- **Bootloader:** MCU/SOC loads bootloader from `/OS/bootloader.bin`, then loads `/OS/os.img` into RAM.
- **Data:** User selects a bank or project; all associated samples/patches are loaded into RAM in one operation.

## 21.17 OS and Data Boot/Load Architecture

### 21.17.1 Comparison: Diskette/HD Boot in Emax/Emu III vs SD Card Boot

| Step                   | Emax/Emu III      | Modern SD-based          |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Power on               | Boot ROM loads disk driver | Boot ROM loads SD driver  |
| OS load                | Reads OS from floppy/SCSI HD | Reads OS from SD card        |
| OS to RAM              | Entire OS copied to RAM | Entire OS copied to RAM      |
| Sound data load        | User selects bank, loads to RAM | User selects bank, loads to RAM |
| Playback               | All runtime in RAM | All runtime in RAM           |

- **Critical Concept:** No part of OS or data is executed or streamed “on the fly”—all is present in RAM before use.

### 21.17.2 Bootloader, OS Partition, and Data Partition Design

- **Bootloader:** Small program in SD card `/OS/` or raw sectors; initializes hardware, mounts FS, loads OS image.
- **OS Partition:** Contains kernel, drivers, app code; may be a monolithic image or modular.
- **Data Partition:** Patches, samples, sequences; may be organized by user, bank, or project.

#### 21.17.2.1 Partition Table Example (MBR)

| Partition | Start | Size    | FS    | Content      |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------|--------------|
| #1        | 0     | 100MB   | FAT32 | /OS/         |
| #2        | 100MB | Rest    | FAT32 | /DATA/, /BACKUP/ |

### 21.17.3 OS Loading Sequence: Power-On to RAM

1. **Power On:** MCU or SoC starts, runs minimal boot ROM.
2. **Detect SD:** Initialize SD interface (SPI or SDIO).
3. **Mount FS:** Read partition table, mount FAT32/exFAT.
4. **Load Bootloader:** Read `/OS/bootloader.bin` into RAM, execute.
5. **Bootloader Loads OS:** Loads `/OS/os.img` (or kernel + modules) into RAM.
6. **Jump to OS Entry Point:** All OS code/data is now in fast local RAM.

#### 21.17.3.1 Bootloader Pseudocode (C-like)

```c
mount_sd();
load_file("/OS/bootloader.bin", RAM_BOOT_ADDR, BOOT_SIZE);
exec(RAM_BOOT_ADDR);
```

### 21.17.4 Data (Samples, Presets, Sequences) Loading Sequence to RAM

1. **User Selects Bank/Project:** UI browses `/DATA/Banks/` or `/DATA/Projects/`.
2. **Enumerate Files:** Read directory; present banks/projects to user.
3. **Load Data:** Read all patches, presets, samples into pre-allocated RAM buffers.
4. **Verify:** Optional checksum/hash of loaded data for integrity.
5. **Ready:** All samples and presets are instantly available—no disk seeks at runtime.

#### 21.17.4.1 Data Load Pseudocode

```c
for each file in /DATA/Banks/BankN/ {
    load_file(file, next_free_ram, file_size);
    next_free_ram += file_size;
}
```

### 21.17.5 RAM Requirements and Sizing

- **Estimate:** RAM must hold largest OS image + largest set of samples/presets needed at once.
- **Typical Legacy:** Emax: 512KB–1MB; Emulator III: up to 8MB; Modern: 64MB–512MB (or more).
- **Modern Design:** Plan for future expansion; use RAM chips with sufficient bandwidth and size (DDR2/3, SRAM, PSRAM).
- **RAM Map Example:**

| Region      | Size   | Use           |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 0x00000000  | 8MB    | OS code/data  |
| 0x00800000  | 32MB   | Samples       |
| 0x02800000  | 8MB    | Presets, UI   |
| ...         | ...    | ...           |

### 21.17.6 Managing OS and Data Updates

- **OS Update:** Replace `/OS/os.img` via SD card reader on PC, or via UI with update file.
- **Atomic Update:** Write to new file, verify, then rename over old OS image.
- **Data Update:** Add/remove banks/projects by copying folders to SD card.
- **Versioning:** Keep previous OS/data versions for rollback in `/BACKUP/`.

---

## 21.18 SD Card Data Management for Audio Workstations

### 21.18.1 Organizing Patches, Samples, Projects on SD

- **Flat:** All banks/projects in a single directory; fast, but can get unwieldy.
- **Hierarchical:** `/DATA/Banks/Bank1/`, `/DATA/Projects/MySong/`; easier for user navigation.
- **Per-Bank:** Samples and patches grouped in subfolders for bulk loading.

#### 21.18.1.1 Directory Example

```
/DATA/Banks/ClassicStrings/
  samples/
    violin_C4.wav
    cello_G2.wav
  patches/
    strings_full.json
    cello_lead.json
```

### 21.18.2 Folder Structures for Fast Access and Versioning

- **Bank Folders:** One folder = one “disk” or “set” (like Emax/Emu III floppy/HDD).
- **Project Folders:** Include all data for a composition, for quick recall or sharing.
- **Versioning:** Append or prefix folders/files with date, version, or hash (e.g., `Bank1-v2/`).

### 21.18.3 Handling Banks, Sets, and Directories for Live Use

- **Bank Selection:** UI lists available banks (by folder name); user selects, workstation loads entire bank to RAM.
- **Set List:** Optionally supports playlist/set list—user can queue up banks/projects for sequential loading.
- **Quick Swap:** Keep last-used banks in RAM or “hot swap” buffer for instant access.

### 21.18.4 Indexing, Search, and Metadata on SD Cards

- **File Index:** At boot or card insert, scan bank/project folders; build in-RAM list of available items.
- **Metadata Files:** Store tags, author, genre, etc. in `metadata.json` or sidecar files per bank/project.
- **Search:** Fast in-RAM or on-card search by name, tag, date, or custom field.
- **Cache:** Optionally cache index for faster startup.

#### 21.18.4.1 Metadata File Example

```json
{
  "bankName": "ClassicStrings",
  "author": "Alice",
  "date": "2025-06-24",
  "tags": ["strings", "orchestral", "vintage"]
}
```

### 21.18.5 Backup, Restore, and SD Card Duplication

- **Backup:** Copy entire SD card to PC, or use built-in backup tool to duplicate banks/projects to `/BACKUP/`.
- **Restore:** UI-driven restore replaces banks/projects from backup or external SD.
- **Duplication:** For sharing, simply copy bank/project folders or image SD card.
- **Safety:** Advise users to keep regular backups, especially before OS/data updates.

## 21.19 Implementation Details: Code, Schematics, and Workflows

### 21.19.1 Typical Bootloader and OS Loader Code for SD Card Boot

#### 21.19.1.1 SD Card Bootloader (Pseudo C)

```c
// Initialize SD
sd_init();
// Mount filesystem
fs_mount("/");
// Load OS image
FILE *osf = fopen("/OS/os.img", "rb");
fread((void*)OS_RAM_ADDR, 1, OS_SIZE, osf);
fclose(osf);
// Jump to OS entry point
jump_to(OS_RAM_ADDR);
```

### 21.19.2 Loading Data into RAM: Patterns, Buffers, Constraints

- **Pattern:** Load all needed files from selected bank/project folder to pre-allocated RAM regions.
- **Memory Map:** Track file offsets and sizes to allow instant access from sound engine.
- **Constraints:** Ensure total size < available RAM; warn user if bank/project too large.

#### 21.19.2.1 Sample Buffer Table Example

| Sample Name   | RAM Offset   | Size (bytes) |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| violin_C4.wav | 0x01000000  | 0x00100000   |
| cello_G2.wav  | 0x01100000  | 0x00120000   |

### 21.19.3 Efficient File Read, Seek, and Chunked Access on SD

- **Sequential Read:** Most efficient for loading large files (samples, OS images).
- **Chunked Loading:** For very large files, read in 4K–64K blocks.
- **Seek:** Use `fseek`/`lseek` for direct access to file offsets.
- **Buffered Read:** OS loader and sample loader may share a single large buffer for all file operations.

### 21.19.4 User Interface for SD Card Operations (Load, Save, Format, Eject)

- **Load:** UI lets user browse `/DATA/`; select bank/project; show progress bar during load.
- **Save:** For sampling/workflow, allow saving new banks/projects to `/DATA/` or `/BACKUP/`.
- **Format:** Option to format SD card (FAT32/exFAT); warning and confirmation required.
- **Eject:** Safely unmount card before removal; prevent data loss.

### 21.19.5 Troubleshooting SD Card Issues: Corruption, Wear, Compatibility

- **Corruption:** Detect via failed reads, bad checksums; suggest backup and reformat.
- **Wear:** Monitor write cycles if possible; warn user as card nears EOL.
- **Compatibility:** Test SD cards from multiple vendors; document tested models.
- **Recovery:** Provide repair tool to fix file system or recover data from bad blocks.

## 21.20 Reference: Emax, Emulator III, SCSI, and Modern SD Card Parallels

### 21.20.1 Emax/Emulator III Disk OS/Data Cycle

- **Boot:** Floppy or SCSI disk contains OS, loaded into RAM at power-up.
- **Bank Load:** User inserts disk or selects set; all data loaded into RAM.
- **Workflow:** All playback, editing, and sequencing occur from RAM—no mid-playback disk access.
- **Save:** User saves new banks/projects back to disk.

### 21.20.2 SCSI/Floppy/HD vs SD Card: Emulation, Timing, and Workflow

| Feature        | Floppy/SCSI/HD | SD Card                |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Boot Speed     | Slow (seconds) | Fast (sub-second)      |
| Capacity       | 1MB–1GB        | 32GB–1TB+              |
| Reliability    | Mechanical wear| Solid-state, wear-leveled|
| Workflow       | Swap disks     | Swap cards/folders     |
| Access         | Sequential     | Random + sequential    |
| Emulation      | SCSI2SD, HxC   | Native SD, SD2SCSI, PiSCSI |

### 21.20.3 Modern SD-based Samplers and Workstations

- **Examples:** Blackaddr Daisy Seed, Polyend Tracker, Deluge, Circuit, DIY Zynthian, MPC Live.
- **Workflows:** SD for OS/data, RAM for runtime—enables classic and modern “disk” workflows.
- **Advantages:** Instant swapping, backup, and sharing; user can easily expand/clone libraries.
