## 18.7 Advanced Pattern and Song Arrangement

### 18.7.1 Pattern Chaining, Song Mode, and Section Transitions

- **Pattern Chaining:** Link multiple patterns to play in sequence (A → B → C).
- **Song Mode:** Arrange patterns into song sections (Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge); set order, repeat counts, and transitions.
- **Section Transitions:** Cue next section instantly or after current pattern ends; supports smooth transitions, fades, and fills.
- **Manual Chain:** Trigger next pattern live for improvisation, or pre-programmed for structured songs.

#### 18.7.1.1 Data Example (Pattern Chain)

```json
{
  "chain": [
    {"pattern": "Intro", "repeat": 2},
    {"pattern": "Verse", "repeat": 4},
    {"pattern": "Chorus", "repeat": 2},
    {"pattern": "Bridge", "repeat": 1},
    {"pattern": "Chorus", "repeat": 4}
  ]
}
```

### 18.7.2 Pattern Variations, Fills, and Conditional Loops

- **Variations:** Each pattern can have A/B/C/D or more variations with subtle or drastic changes (used for verse/chorus, live improvisation).
- **Fills:** Short patterns inserted on demand (e.g., drum fill, FX hit); can be triggered or auto-inserted at end of section.
- **Conditional Loops:** Loop a section only if a condition is met (e.g., after 3 repeats, on cue, if a controller is pressed).

### 18.7.3 Song Structure: Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Custom Forms

- **Named Sections:** Patterns labeled as “Verse”, “Chorus”, etc., for easy arrangement and recall.
- **Custom Forms:** User-defined sequence of any pattern; supports odd meters, polyrhythms, complex arrangements.
- **Markers:** Set jump points (e.g., “Go to Chorus”); useful for live performers.

### 18.7.4 Arrangement Editing: Copy, Paste, Drag, Repeat, Merge

- **Copy/Paste:** Duplicate patterns, sections, or steps for fast composition.
- **Drag:** Rearrange patterns/sections with drag-and-drop or hardware controls.
- **Repeat:** Quickly set repeat count for a pattern or section.
- **Merge:** Combine patterns or steps (e.g., create longer patterns, blend fills into main sequence).

### 18.7.5 Cue Lists, Scene Recall, and Live Arrangement

- **Cue List:** Pre-programmed sequence of scenes/patterns for live sets; can be edited on the fly.
- **Scene Recall:** Instantly load full sequencer state (patterns, mutes, automation) for a specific song section.
- **Live Arrangement:** Jump between patterns/scenes with quantized transitions; supports improvisation and setlists.

## 18.8 Performance Features: Playback, Macros, and Live Workflow

### 18.8.1 Mute/Solo, Real-Time Remix, and Pattern Jump

- **Mute/Solo:** Per-track, per-pattern, or per-step; instantly drop or isolate elements during playback.
- **Real-Time Remix:** Swap patterns, variations, or steps without stopping the sequencer.
- **Pattern Jump:** Instantly switch to another pattern; jump can be quantized to bar/beat or immediate.

### 18.8.2 Live Parameter Automation, Fill-Ins, and Roll/Repeat

- **Live Automation:** Record or perform parameter changes (filter, FX, pan) in real-time and loop/recall them.
- **Fill-In:** Trigger short, alternative pattern (drum fill, break) on demand; returns to main pattern automatically.
- **Roll/Repeat:** Rapid retrigger of notes/steps at set rates (e.g., trap hats, snare rolls).

### 18.8.3 Scene Morphing, Snapshot Recall, and Hands-Free Control

- **Scene Morphing:** Gradually blend between two or more scenes (patterns, mixes, or parameter sets).
- **Snapshot Recall:** Save/recall exact sequencer state at any moment; supports undo/redo and performance safety.
- **Hands-Free Control:** Footswitches, MIDI pedals, gesture sensors to trigger scene changes, mutes, fills.

### 18.8.4 Performance Macros and User-Defined Controls

- **Macros:** Assign multiple parameters (mute, FX, filter, pattern jump) to a single control for dramatic changes.
- **User-Defined:** Map hardware knobs/sliders/pads to any function (mute, solo, pattern select, automation).
- **Morph Pads:** XY or grid pads for blending between multiple parameters or scenes in real-time.

### 18.8.5 Quantize, Swing, and Groove in Performance

- **Live Quantize:** Snap incoming notes/automation to grid while performing.
- **Swing Adjustment:** Change groove/swing on the fly for different sections or styles.

## 18.9 Algorithmic and Generative Sequencing

### 18.9.1 Euclidean, Polyrhythmic, and Probability-Based Sequencing

- **Euclidean Sequencing:** Divide steps as evenly as possible (e.g., 5 hits in 16 steps); popular for world and electronic rhythms.
- **Polyrhythms:** Independent step lengths or rates per track (e.g., 4/4 vs 3/4).
- **Probability:** Each step/note has a percent chance of playing; supports organic, evolving patterns.

#### 18.9.1.1 Example: Euclidean Generator (Python)

```python
def euclidean_rhythm(steps, pulses):
    pattern = []
    bucket = 0
    for i in range(steps):
        bucket += pulses
        if bucket >= steps:
            bucket -= steps
            pattern.append(1)
        else:
            pattern.append(0)
    return pattern
```

### 18.9.2 Randomization, Mutation, and Humanization

### 18.9.3 Conditional Steps, Ratchets, and Step Logic

- **Conditional Steps:** Play only on certain bars, pattern repeats, or when other steps are silent/active.
- **Ratchets:** Divide a step into multiple rapid retriggers (e.g., 1/32 hi-hats).
- **Step Logic:** IF/THEN logic for advanced sequencing (e.g., if velocity > 100, trigger extra note).

### 18.9.4 Arpeggiators, Chord Generators, and Motif Sequencers

- **Arpeggiator:** Automatically play notes of a chord in sequence (up, down, random, pattern); adjustable rate, octave range.
- **Chord Generator:** Adds harmonically appropriate notes to monophonic input.
- **Motif Sequencer:** Generates melodic/rhythmic ideas based on rules or user input.

### 18.9.5 Integration with LFOs, Envelopes, and Mod Matrix

- **LFOs:** Modulate step parameters, note values, velocities, or FX in sync with sequence.
- **Envelopes:** Shape pattern or step values over time (e.g., fade-in, crescendo).
- **Mod Matrix:** Route any modulator to any pattern parameter (e.g., step probability, groove amount).

### 18.9.6 Algorithmic Sequencing UI and Visualization

- **Pattern Preview:** Show generated/modified pattern visually.
- **Algorithm Settings:** Controls for probability, division, mutation rate, etc.

```python
class Step:
    def __init__(self):
        self.notes = []  # list of (pitch, velocity)
        self.cc = []     # list of (cc, value)
        self.locks = {}  # parameter locks

- **Profile under performance load**: Simulate heavy usage (lots of tracks, automation, patterns) to catch timing issues.
- **Make undo/redo clear and fast**: Maximum confidence for users during creative work.
- **Provide visual feedback**: Active steps, performance macros, and automation should be clearly displayed.
- **Design for expandability**: Support user scripts, plug-ins, and modular architecture for future features.
