## 29.6 Assembly Processes: SMT, THT, Reflow, and Manual

### 29.6.1 SMT (Surface Mount Technology) Assembly Process

- **Stencil Printing:** Stainless steel stencil aligns over PCB; solder paste applied via squeegee.  
  - Paste: Mix of powdered solder and flux.
  - Stencil design: Apertures sized for part pads, optimized for release and volume.
- **Pick-and-Place:** PCB moves to machine; components picked from feeders/trays, placed on paste with high-speed head.
  - Camera alignment for 0201, QFN, BGA, etc.
- **Reflow Soldering:** Entire board heated in controlled oven; solder paste melts, forming joints.
  - Profile: Preheat, soak, reflow, cool-down (see 29.6.5).
- **Post-Reflow:** Visual inspection, AOI, repair of tombstoned, misaligned, or missing parts.

#### 29.6.1.1 SMT Defects Table

| Defect       | Cause                 | Fix/Prevention                   |
|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Tombstoning  | Uneven heating/paste  | Stencil aperture, oven tuning    |
| Bridging     | Excess paste, fine pitch | Stencil design, paste type    |
| Cold Joint   | Low temp, poor contact| Oven profile, board preheat      |
| Solder Ball  | Moisture, paste issue | Dry storage, paste control       |

### 29.6.2 THT (Through-Hole Technology) and Mixed Assembly

- **THT:** Components inserted in drilled holes, leads bent or clinched.
- **Wave Solder:** Board passes over molten solder wave; all exposed pads soldered in one pass.
- **Selective Solder:** For mixed boards, robotically solder only specific areas.
- **Hand Soldering:** For prototypes, high-power, or odd-shaped parts.
- **Mixed Assembly:** SMT first (reflow), then THT (wave/selective/hand).

### 29.6.3 Solder Paste Application and Stencil Design

- **Stencil Thickness:** 100–150μm for most SMT; thicker for large parts, thinner for fine-pitch.
- **Aperture Reduction:** 10–15% less than pad for fine pitch to avoid bridging.
- **Stencil Cleaning:** Automated between prints; manual for small runs.
- **Paste Storage:** Refrigerated, brought to room temp before use.

### 29.6.4 Pick-and-Place Machines: Setup, Programming, and Operation

- **Setup:** Load feeders/trays, program XY positions, vision fiducials.
- **Programming:** Import centroid file (CSV from CAD), teach odd parts.
- **Operation:** Regular nozzle cleaning, feeder checks, vision calibration.
- **Speed:** 10,000–100,000+ parts/hour; slower for high-mix, prototype.

### 29.6.5 Reflow Soldering: Profiles and Challenges

- **Profile Stages:**
  - Preheat (ramp): Gradually heat to avoid thermal shock.
  - Soak: Hold to activate flux and even temperature.
  - Reflow: Peak temp (235–250°C for lead-free), solder melts.
  - Cooling: Controlled to avoid cracked joints.
- **Challenges:** Warping (large boards), sensitive parts (connectors, batteries), moisture-sensitive parts (ICs pop/cook).

#### 29.6.5.1 Example: Lead-Free Reflow Profile

| Stage      | Temp (°C) | Time (s) |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Preheat    | 150–180   | 60–90    |
| Soak       | 180–200   | 90–120   |
| Reflow     | 235–250   | 40–60    |
| Cooling    | <100      | 60–90    |

### 29.6.6 Wave Soldering and Selective Soldering

- **Wave Solder:** Used for THT; board passes over solder wave, all exposed metal is soldered.
- **Selective Solder:** Robot moves solder nozzle to each pad; used for mixed SMT/THT, or high-density boards.
- **Masking:** Keep-out pads for SMT, or use glue to hold SMT during wave.

### 29.6.7 Hand Assembly: When and How to Use

- **When:** Prototyping, repair, unique or low-volume builds, large/odd parts, connectors.
- **How:** Temperature-controlled iron, ESD precautions, good solder technique (IPC-610).
- **Verification:** Magnifier or microscope, continuity test.

### 29.6.8 Cleaning, Inspection, and Handling

- **Cleaning:** Remove flux residues (especially for no-clean flux if not encapsulated), use IPA or deflux chemicals.
- **Inspection:** Visual, AOI for production; 10x–40x magnifier for hand.
- **Handling:** ESD safe gloves/wrist straps, clean room for sensitive assemblies.

## 29.7 Automated Inspection and Quality Assurance

### 29.7.1 Automated Optical Inspection (AOI)

- **Defect Logging:** All defects logged for feedback and process improvement.

### 29.7.2 X-ray and Advanced Inspection for BGA/QFN

- **X-ray:** Only way to inspect BGA, QFN, and bottom-terminated packages.
- **Void detection:** Large voids in solder can cause failures.
- **Resolution:** Higher-res for fine-pitch, lower for large parts.

### 29.7.3 In-Circuit Test (ICT) and Boundary Scan

- **ICT:** “Bed of nails” fixture probes test pads; checks shorts, opens, value, orientation.
- **Boundary Scan (JTAG):** Digital test for ICs with JTAG; test logic built into chip.
- **Test Coverage:** Not 100%—analog and hidden nets may be missed.

### 29.7.4 Functional Test Jigs and Fixtures

- **Custom Test Jigs:** Simulate real-world use (audio in/out, MIDI, USB, network).
- **Automation:** Microcontrollers or PC test scripts to run and log tests.
- **Fixtures:** “Pogo pins” for temporary connections; can program firmware and test in the same step.

### 29.7.5 Programming: Firmware, Serial Numbers, Calibration

- **Firmware Programming:** JTAG, SWD, ISP, or bootloader; often done after initial power-on.
- **Serial Numbers:** Laser marking, barcode, or EEPROM/flash programmed at test.
- **Calibration:** Audio level, offset, or reference voltages set and stored in NVM.

### 29.7.6 Burn-In and Environmental Stress Screening (ESS)

- **Burn-In:** Run at elevated temp/load; catches early-life (infant mortality) failures.
- **ESS:** Temp/humidity cycling, vibration, power cycling.
- **Duration:** 8–48 hours typical; longer for critical gear.

### 29.7.7 Final QA, Packaging, and Labeling

- **Final QA:** Visual, functional, and safety checks before boxing.
- **Packaging:** Antistatic bags, foam, cartons with drop/impact testing.
- **Labeling:** Product/model, serial, compliance marks (CE, FCC, RoHS), date code.
