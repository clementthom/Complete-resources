## 30.108 Clocking and Timing: System, Envelope, LFO, and Polyphonic Coordination

### 30.108.1 Main System Clock: Crystal, Divider, and Distribution

- **Crystal Oscillator**:  
  - 12MHz fundamental, divided by 12/24/48 for CPU, panel, and subsystem clocks.
  - Clock buffer (74HC04/74LS04) fans out to CPU, timer/counter ICs, and critical timing peripherals.
- **Clock Trees**:  
  - Distribution carefully routed with matched trace lengths to reduce skew and jitter.
  - Analog and digital clocks kept separate to avoid digital noise on CV rails and audio paths.

### 30.108.2 Envelope/LFO Clocking: Digital Rate Control, Sync, and Phase Alignment

- **Envelope Gen**:  
  - Each envelope (DADSR) triggered by a note-on, clocked by digital timer—rate set by patch parameter, modulated by CV.
  - LFO clocks: Digital rate control, phase can be reset (sync) per voice or globally.
- **Phase Alignment**:  
  - For unison or special effects, CPU can globally reset LFOs or envelopes so all voices start together.
- **Sync-to-Clock**:  
  - LFO or env speed can be locked to external MIDI clock or analog sync, using timer interrupt for precise placement.

### 30.108.3 Voice Engine Timing: Note-On/Off, Gate Pulse, and Polyphonic Accuracy

- **Note-On**:  
  - CPU sets gate high, triggers envelope, updates Voice Assign Table.
  - Gate timing: pulse width and timing controlled to within ±50μs for tight polyphony.
- **Note-Off**:  
  - CPU sets gate low, triggers release portion of envelope, releases voice after decay.
- **Polyphonic Accuracy**:  
  - Jitter measured <100μs between earliest and latest voice on stacked chord; critical for tight unison and split/layer modes.

### 30.108.4 Timing Jitter, Latency, and Real-Time Performance

- **Sources of Jitter**:  
  - Software task preemption, interrupt latency, timer inaccuracy.
  - Panel/keyboard events buffered to avoid blocking real-time tasks.
- **Latency**:  
  - Note-on to sound: typically 2–5ms, worst-case under load <10ms.
  - Panel to parameter change: <20ms for most UI actions.
- **Mitigation**:  
  - Real-time tasks (matrix, voice engine) run at highest priority, background tasks yield on interrupt.

## 30.109 External Sync, Master/Slave Operation, and Advanced Integration

### 30.109.1 External Clock Input: Circuit, Buffering, and Precision

- **Input Circuit**:  
  - 1/8" or 1/4" jack, AC-coupled, input protection diodes.
  - Schmitt trigger buffer (74HC14) shapes edge, outputs logic-level pulse to CPU.
- **Precision**:  
  - Pulse width and period measured by timer/counter; clock drift <0.1% over 1 minute.
  - Can accept wide range of input voltage (2–12Vpp), frequency (0.5–200Hz).

### 30.109.2 MIDI Sync: Start/Stop, Song Position, and Sync-to-Clock

- **MIDI Sync**:  
  - Handles MIDI Start (0xFA), Stop (0xFC), Clock (0xF8), SPP (0xF2).
  - CPU timer advances LFO, envelopes, sequencer/arpeggiator in lockstep with incoming clock.
- **Song Position**:  
  - SPP message sets beat/bar position; used to synchronize Matrix-12 to DAWs or drum machines.
- **Latency**:  
  - MIDI event to action <2ms; clock drift <0.2ms per minute with good MIDI source.

### 30.109.3 Arpeggiator and Sequencer (if present): Timing, Quantization, and Polyphonic Logic

- **Arpeggiator**:  
  - Steps through held notes at clock rate, pattern controlled by user (up/down/random/chord).
  - Quantization: Notes snapped to nearest clock tick.
- **Sequencer**:  
  - If present, runs as background task, pattern data stored in RAM, events scheduled via timer.

### 30.110.2 Potential for Voice Expansion, Digital Effects, and Modern Upgrades

- **Voice Expansion**:  
  - Theoretically possible—firmware would need to support more than 12 voices, expansion bus could address new voice boards.
- **Digital Effects**:  
  - Expansion could support digital FX (reverb, delay) with memory-mapped registers.
- **Modern Upgrades**:  
  - USB/MIDI, flash patch storage, real-time controllers, web-based UI over serial/WiFi.

### 30.110.3 Direct Memory Access, Panel/Keyboard Expansion, and Firmware Hooks

- **DMA**:  
  - Advanced peripherals (e.g., audio sampler) could DMA to/from CPU RAM.
- **Panel/Keyboard Expansion**:  
  - Extra keys, encoders, or touchpads can be scanned via expansion bus.
- **Firmware Hooks**:  
  - Reserved vectors, memory regions, and I/O registers allow for future expansion and field upgrades.
