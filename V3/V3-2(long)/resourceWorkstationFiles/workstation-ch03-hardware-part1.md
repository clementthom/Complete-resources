## 3.1 Introduction

The hardware platform is the heart of the workstation, providing the physical foundation for all digital and analog processes, user interaction, and extensibility. This section takes a comprehensive, reference-grade approach to designing, selecting, and assembling a hardware system robust enough for professional music production, performance, and advanced DIY experimentation. The focus is on hybrid systems, with both digital (BCM283x SoC) and analog (VCF/VCA/Op-amp) components, and scalable architectures that support modular expansion.

## 3.4 Power Supply Design and Management

### 3.4.1 Requirements

- **Multi-Rail:** Separate analog and digital rails to minimize noise.
- **Voltage Rails:** At least +5V (digital), ±12V (analog audio), optional +3.3V for logic and sensors.
- **Current Capacity:** Must handle all subsystems at peak load (CPU, USB, display, audio, expansion).
- **Battery Option:** For portable builds, include charging and protection circuits.

### 3.4.2 Power Tree Example

```
[DC IN 12-24V] 
     |
[EMI Filter] 
     |
[Power Switch / Sequencer]
     |
+-------------------+-----------------+
|                   |                 |
[+5V Regulator]     [+12V Reg]       [-12V Reg]
|                   |                 |
[SoC, USB, Logic]   [Analog Audio]    [Analog Audio]
```

### 3.4.3 Best Practices

- **Analog/Digital Isolation:** Use ferrite beads or LC filters between digital and analog rails.
- **Grounding:** Star ground layout, with separate returns for analog and digital domains, joined at a single point near the power entry.
- **Protection:** Polyfuse, TVS diodes, reverse polarity protection on DC input.
- **Sequencing:** Power up analog rails before digital where possible to avoid "thump" in audio path.

**Tip:**  
For Raspberry Pi-based builds, avoid back-powering the Pi via GPIO; always use the main power connector and split analog rails downstream.
