## 30.213 Digital Effects: Hardware, Algorithms, and Routing

### 30.213.1 Effects Hardware: DSP Boards, Memory, and Bus Integration

- **DSP Boards**:  
  - Early Synclavier effects implemented with discrete logic and static RAM; later models use Motorola DSP56000, custom gate arrays, and fast SRAM (16–64kB per effect).
  - Effects board connects to backplane, addressed by CPU and sequencer for parameter updates.
- **Bus Integration**:  
  - Effects bus is time-multiplexed with voice and sample buses; real-time audio routed to effects board via digital or analog bus.
  - Effects parameters set via mapped registers; audio blocks DMA’d to and from effects RAM.
- **Memory**:  
  - Double-buffered RAM for block-based processing (e.g., 1–5 ms blocks).
  - Parameter RAM for effect state, automation, and patch recall.

### 30.213.2 Effects Algorithms: Reverb, Delay, Chorus, EQ, Modulation

- **Reverb**:  
  - Multi-tap delay with feedback, all-pass/combs, room size/decay parameters.
  - FIR/IIR filters for tone shaping; selectable early/late reflection models.
- **Delay**:  
  - Mono/stereo, up to several seconds, feedback, tap tempo, modulation.
- **Chorus/Flanger**:  
  - LFO-modulated delay lines, feedback, depth/rate/phase controls.
- **EQ**:  
  - 2–8 band parametric, shelving, or graphic.
- **Modulation**:  
  - Tremolo, vibrato, autopan, phaser; LFOs syncable to sequencer, MIDI, or internal clock.

### 30.213.3 Effects Routing: Insert, Send/Return, and Summing Busses

- **Insert vs. Send**:  
  - Insert: effect directly in audio path, per-voice or global.
  - Send/Return: effect receives mix of inputs, returns processed signal to sum bus.
- **Routing**:  
  - Routing table stored in RAM; CPU updates on patch change or panel command.
  - Per-voice, per-partial, or global assignment; flexible patching for complex chains.
- **Summing**:  
  - Digital sum for clarity; analog sum for warmth (user-selectable in later models).

### 30.213.4 Effects Editing: UI, Parameters, and Automation

- **UI**:  
  - Terminal or panel-based, with real-time parameter display and softkey selection.
- **Parameter Automation**:  
  - Sequencer or external MIDI can automate any effect parameter.
  - Macros can sweep multiple parameters, with interpolation and tempo sync.

- **Physical Layer**:  
  - RS-422 differential pair, 9-pin D-sub, up to 500 meters.
  - Daisy-chain or star topology; termination resistors at endpoints.
- **Protocol**:  
  - Packet-based, with address, command, data, and CRC.
  - Arbitration: token or master-slave (CPU as master, panels as slaves).
- **Speed**:  
  - 115.2 kbps typical; supports panel updates, remote file access, and limited sample transfer.

### 30.214.2 Remote Operations: Control Surfaces, Multi-User Sessions

- **Remote Panels**:  
  - Full-featured terminals, button panels, remote LCDs.
  - Multiple users can control different system aspects; locking prevents conflicts.
- **Session Management**:  
  - User logins, session IDs, access control lists for patch/sample/sequence ownership.

### 30.214.3 Inter-Synclavier Networking: Sample/Sequence Sharing, Distributed Audio

- **Sample/Sequence Sharing**:  
  - Transfer patches, samples, sequences between Synclavier systems over NEDNet (or, later, TCP/IP).
- **Distributed Audio**:  
  - Synchronize playback/record across multiple systems; sample-accurate start/stop, master clock distribution.

### 30.214.4 Modernization: TCP/IP Bridges and Remote Access

- **Bridges**:  
  - NEDNet-to-Ethernet bridges allow remote control from modern computers.
- **Web/Remote UI**:  
  - Modern UIs (web, tablet) use protocol translation for real-time monitoring, control, and patch backup.

- **Running Status**:  
  - Last status byte held; only new data bytes sent for repeated message types.
- **MIDI Merge**:  
  - Input from local panel/keyboard merged with external MIDI for output/processing.
- **Thru**:  
  - Hardware/firmware THRU for chaining synths; optionally filtered by channel or type.

### 30.215.3 MIDI Mapping: Parameter Assignment, Macro, and Automation

- **Mapping Table**:  
  - User-assignable mappings from MIDI CC/NRPN to any internal parameter (FM/mod index, effect, macro, etc).
- **Macro Control**:  
  - MIDI CC can sweep macro parameters, trigger patch changes, or automate effects.
- **Automation**:  
  - Sequencer and external MIDI can both automate any assignable parameter, with interpolation and tempo sync.

### 30.215.4 Synchronization: MIDI Clock, MTC, and Hybrid Sync

- **MIDI Clock**:  
  - Sync sequencer, LFOs, effects to external clock.
- **MTC (MIDI Time Code)**:  
  - Frame-accurate sync with external DAW, tape, or video.
- **Hybrid Sync**:  
  - Simultaneous SMPTE + MIDI clock for tightest possible external integration.

- **Spectral Shaping**:  
  - Real-time spectral filtering, envelope following, morphing between timbres.

### 30.216.3 Macro and Performance Controls: Assignment, Mapping, Feedback

- **Macro Assignment**:  
  - Panel and MIDI assignable to any combination of synthesis, sample, sequencer, or effect parameters.

*This part delivers all technical, service, and expansion knowledge for a Synclavier recreation or emulator.  
If you want even more detailed breakdowns (e.g., card-level schematics, deep service case studies, or source code for NEDNet), please specify before I proceed. Otherwise, I will begin with the Fairlight CMI case study next.*
