## 23.6 Overview: Effects Types and DSP Building Blocks

DSP effects transform, enhance, or modify audio signals.  
Categories:
- **EQ/Tone:** Frequency shaping (EQ, filters)
- **Dynamics:** Volume shaping (compressor, limiter, expander, gate)
- **Time-Based:** Spatial and temporal effects (delay, reverb, chorus, flanger)
- **Harmonic/Distortion:** Add harmonics (saturation, overdrive, bitcrush)
- **Modulation:** Periodic parameter changes (tremolo, vibrato, auto-pan)
- **Mixing/Summing:** Combine and route audio (mixers, panners, bus processors)

All effects share core building blocks: buffers, filters, delay lines, envelope followers, LFOs, nonlinear maps, and parameter smoothing.

---

## 23.7 Equalization (EQ): Theory, Algorithms, and Applications

### 23.7.1 Types of Filters: Low/High-Pass, Shelving, Peaking, Notch

- **Low-Pass (LPF):** Attenuates frequencies above cutoff.
- **High-Pass (HPF):** Attenuates frequencies below cutoff.
- **Band-Pass (BPF):** Passes a band, attenuates above/below.
- **Notch:** Cuts a narrow frequency band.
- **Peaking:** Boost/cut around a center frequency.
- **Shelving:** Boost/cut all frequencies above/below a shelf point.

#### 23.7.1.1 Filter Response Example

- LPF: Useful for removing hiss, taming brightness.
- HPF: Remove rumble, DC, low-end mud.
- Peaking: Tuning resonance, accentuating or cutting specific tones.

### 23.7.2 Digital Filter Structures: IIR, FIR, Biquad, State-Variable

- **IIR (Infinite Impulse Response):** Recursive, compact, can emulate analog curves. Prone to instability if not carefully designed.
- **FIR (Finite Impulse Response):** Non-recursive, always stable, phase-linear designs possible, more CPU.
- **Biquad:** Second-order IIR, building block for most EQ bands.  
- **State-Variable:** Flexible, can output LP, HP, BP, Notch simultaneously.

#### 23.7.2.1 Example: Biquad Filter (Direct Form I, C Pseudocode)

```c
typedef struct { float a0,a1,a2,b1,b2, z1,z2; } Biquad;
float process_biquad(Biquad* f, float x) {
    float y = f->a0*x + f->a1*f->z1 + f->a2*f->z2 - f->b1*f->z1 - f->b2*f->z2;
    f->z2 = f->z1; f->z1 = x;
    return y;
}
```

### 23.7.3 Parametric, Graphic, and Fixed EQ Implementations

- **Parametric EQ:** User sets freq, Q, and gain for each band; implemented via cascaded biquads.
- **Graphic EQ:** Fixed bands (e.g., 31-band, 1/3 octave), sliders for each; usually FIR or IIR filters.
- **Fixed EQ:** Simple tone controls (bass, mid, treble), often shelving/peaking.

#### 23.7.3.1 UI Example

- Parametric EQ: Drag handles on frequency plot, real-time spectral feedback.
- Graphic EQ: Vertical sliders for each band.

### 23.7.4 Real-Time Parameter Smoothing and Automation

- **Smoothing:** Prevents zipper noise when changing freq/gain/Q; use 1-pole filters or interpolated coefficients.
- **Automation:** Host/DAW or sequencer can sweep parameters; DSP must interpolate smoothly per sample or block.

#### 23.7.4.1 Parameter Smoothing (C Example)

```c
// Simple 1-pole smoothing
float smooth(float last, float target, float coeff) {
    return last + coeff * (target - last);
}
```

### 23.7.5 Practical EQ UI and Audio Examples

- **Spectrum Analyzer:** Overlay FFT for visual feedback.
- **Presets:** Genre or instrument-specific EQ curves.
- **A/B Compare:** Instantly toggle EQ on/off for critical listening.

## 23.8 Dynamic Effects: Compression, Limiting, Expansion, Gating

### 23.8.1 Envelope Follower and Detector Design

- **Envelope Follower:** Smooths absolute value of signal for level detection.
  - Peak, RMS, or hybrid detector.
- **Attack/Release:** Control how fast detector responds to level changes.
- **Rectifier:** Full-wave preferred for envelope followers.

#### 23.8.1.1 Envelope Follower (C Example)

```c
float envelope = 0.0f;
float attack = ...;  // 0.01..0.5
float release = ...; // 0.1..1.0
float x = fabsf(sample);
if (x > envelope)
    envelope = attack * (envelope - x) + x;
else
    envelope = release * (envelope - x) + x;
```

### 23.8.2 Threshold, Ratio, Attack/Release, Knee

- **Threshold:** Level above/below which compression/gating occurs.
- **Ratio:** Slope of input/output above threshold (e.g., 4:1).
- **Attack/Release:** How quickly compression/gating engages/disengages.
- **Knee:** Hard (sharp transition) or soft (gradual) between no comp and full ratio.

#### 23.8.2.1 Compression Curve Example

```
Input Level -----
     |
     +---[No compression]---(Threshold)----[Compression: reduced slope]
```

### 23.8.3 Sidechain and Ducking Techniques

- **Sidechain:** External or internal source triggers compression/gate.
- **Ducking:** Common in broadcast/music; lowers music volume when voice detected.

#### 23.8.3.1 Sidechain Routing Diagram

```
[Main Signal] ─┬─[Compressor]─→ Out
               |
[Sidechain] ---┘
```

### 23.8.4 Lookahead, Upward/Downward Compression, Multi-Band

- **Lookahead:** Delay signal so compressor can react in advance—requires buffer, introduces latency.
- **Upward Compression:** Boosts quiet signals, keeps loud signals unchanged.
- **Downward Compression:** Classic comp—reduces loud signals.
- **Multiband:** Split signal into bands, compress each separately, then sum.

### 23.8.5 Code Patterns for Real-Time Dynamics

- **Block Processing:** Gain computation once per block, or sample-accurate for “snappy” FX.
- **Peak Hold/Release:** Optional for LED/metering visualization.
- **Stereo Link:** Detect level across channels, apply same gain for stereo coherence.

---

## 23.9 Time-Based Effects: Delay, Echo, Chorus, Flanger, Phaser

### 23.9.1 Delay Lines, Feedback Paths, and Interpolation

- **Delay Line:** Circular/ring buffer holds past samples; read delayed output at write-head minus delay.
- **Feedback:** Output of delay line mixed back into input for echoes/repeats.
- **Interpolation:** For non-integer delays (modulation), use linear, cubic, or allpass interpolation.

#### 23.9.1.1 Delay Line (C Example)

```c
#define DLEN 44100
float delay[DLEN];
int wptr = 0;
void process(float in, float delay_samples, float feedback) {
    int rptr = (wptr - (int)delay_samples + DLEN) % DLEN;
    float out = delay[rptr];
    delay[wptr] = in + out * feedback;
    wptr = (wptr + 1) % DLEN;
}
```

### 23.9.2 Modulated Delay (Chorus, Flanger) Algorithms

- **Chorus:** Delay time modulated by slow LFO (5–20ms), multiple voices.
- **Flanger:** Short modulated delay (1–10ms), high feedback, strong comb filtering.
- **Stereo Chorus:** Multiple delay lines, out-of-phase LFOs for width.

### 23.9.3 Phaser: All-Pass Filters and Feedback

- **All-Pass Filter:** Alters phase, not amplitude; cascade for “phasing” effect.
- **Feedback:** Increases resonance and depth.
- **Modulation:** LFO sweeps filter parameters.

#### 23.9.3.1 All-Pass Filter (C Example)

```c
float process_apf(float x, float *z, float a) {
    float y = -a * x + *z;
    *z = x + a * y;
    return y;
}
```

### 23.9.4 Tap Delay, Ping-Pong, and Multitap Variants

- **Tap Delay:** Multiple independent delay taps; each with its own time/level/pan.
- **Ping-Pong:** Alternates repeats between left/right channels.
- **Multitap:** Used for rhythmic FX, echo patterns, complex space.

### 23.9.5 Sync to Tempo, Modulation, and Parameter Control

- **Tempo Sync:** Delay times quantized to beats/bars (e.g., 1/8, dotted 1/4).
- **Modulation:** Delay time, feedback, pan can be modulated by LFO, envelope, automation.
- **Parameter Morph:** Smooth transitions between delay times/feedback to avoid clicks.

## 23.10 Reverb: Room, Plate, Convolution, Algorithmic

### 23.10.1 Basic Reverb Building Blocks: Comb and All-Pass Filters

- **Comb Filter:** Short delay with feedback, creates “early reflections”.
- **All-Pass Filter:** Smears phase, adds diffusion.
- **Network:** Multiple combs and all-pass in cascade/parallel approximate room response.

#### 23.10.1.1 Comb Filter (C Example)

```c
#define CLEN 2205
float comb[CLEN];
int comb_ptr = 0;
float process_comb(float in, float feedback) {
    float out = comb[comb_ptr];
    comb[comb_ptr] = in + out * feedback;
    comb_ptr = (comb_ptr + 1) % CLEN;
    return out;
}
```

### 23.10.2 Schroeder, Moorer, and Modern Algorithmic Reverbs

- **Schroeder:** Classic design, parallel combs + series all-pass for basic reverb.
- **Moorer:** Adds more diffusion, taps, and modulation for realism.
- **Modern:** Modulated comb/all-pass, multi-band/plate/hall/room algorithms, stereo/3D spatialization.

### 23.10.3 Early Reflections, Late Reverb, and Diffusion

- **Early Reflections:** Simulate direct bounces; critical for spatial impression.
- **Late Reverb:** Dense, diffuse tail; “wash” of sound.
- **Diffusion:** All-pass or modulated delay to scatter energy, avoid metallic sound.

### 23.10.4 Convolution Reverb: IR Capture, Storage, and Playback

- **Impulse Response (IR):** Record real space or hardware unit; store as WAV/FLAC.
- **Convolution:** Convolve incoming audio with IR; requires fast FFT or partitioned convolution for real-time.
- **Storage:** Large IRs (100k+ samples), streamed from disk or preloaded.
- **Hybrid:** Combine algorithmic and convolution for efficiency.

### 23.10.5 Tuning, Damping, Pre-Delay, and Parameterization

- **Pre-Delay:** Initial gap before reverb starts; simulates room size.
- **Damping:** High-frequency loss over time, simulates absorptive surfaces.
- **Decay:** Tail length, often in seconds (RT60).
- **Width/Spread:** Stereo imaging, crossfeed, 3D placement.

---

## 23.11 Harmonic and Distortion Effects: Saturation, Clipping, Waveshaping

### 23.11.1 Soft vs Hard Clipping, Tube/Tape Emulation

- **Hard Clipping:** Instant cutoff at threshold; creates strong odd harmonics, “digital” sound.
- **Soft Clipping:** Gradual limiting; more “analog” harmonics.
- **Tube/Tape:** Nonlinear transfer, often with memory (hysteresis, frequency response, cross-modulation).

#### 23.11.1.1 Soft Clipping (C Example)

```c
float soft_clip(float x) {
    if (x > 1.0f) return (2.0f/3.0f);
    if (x < -1.0f) return -(2.0f/3.0f);
    return x - (x*x*x)/3.0f;
}
```

### 23.11.2 Waveshaping Functions, Lookup Tables, Anti-Aliasing

- **Waveshaping:** Apply nonlinear function to input (polynomial, tanh, sigmoid, etc.).
- **Lookup Table:** Precompute for speed, especially on embedded DSP.
- **Anti-Aliasing:** Oversample before nonlinearity, lowpass after.

### 23.11.3 Bitcrush, Sample Rate Reduction, and Lo-Fi FX

- **Bitcrush:** Reduce bit depth, quantize; emulates 8/12-bit samplers.
- **Sample Rate Reduction:** Hold sample for N cycles; produces aliasing, “vintage digital” sound.
- **Noise Injection:** Add white/pink noise for “grit”.

### 23.11.4 Multi-Stage and Parallel Harmonic Processing

- **Multi-stage:** Multiple clipping/saturation stages for complex harmonics.
- **Parallel:** Dry + multiple processed paths summed for richer textures.

---

## 23.12 Modulation Effects: Tremolo, Vibrato, Auto-Pan, Ring Mod

### 23.12.1 LFO Design and Anti-Aliasing

- **LFO Waveforms:** Sine, triangle, square, saw, random; interpolated for smoothness.
- **Frequency Range:** 0.1Hz (slow sweep) to 20Hz+ (audio-rate modulation).
- **Anti-Aliasing:** Interpolate, bandlimit, or use BLEP for sharp waves.

### 23.12.2 Envelope and Audio-Rate Modulation

- **Envelope:** Modulate FX parameters (depth, speed) with amplitude envelope, velocity, etc.
- **Audio-Rate:** For ring mod, FM, AM, or wild FX; must be efficient and carefully anti-aliased.

### 23.12.3 Stereo/Spatial Modulation Patterns

- **Auto-Pan:** LFO modulates left/right balance.
- **Rotary Speaker:** Simulate Leslie effect, multi-LFO, crossfade.
- **Stereo Spread:** Out-of-phase LFOs for width.

---

## 23.13 Mixing and Summing: Architecture and Implementation

### 23.13.1 Floating, Fixed, and Hybrid Mix Busses

- **Floating Point:** High dynamic range, no internal clipping, easy summing.
- **Fixed Point:** More efficient on embedded, but careful scaling needed.
- **Hybrid:** Float for mix, fixed for I/O or DSP blocks.

### 23.13.2 Summing Strategies: Headroom, Anti-Denormal, Dithering

- **Headroom:** Mix with extra margin (e.g., -6dB) to avoid clipping.
- **Anti-Denormal:** Add tiny noise to avoid CPU spikes with near-zero float values.
- **Dithering:** Add noise before bit reduction for smoother sound.

### 23.13.3 Pan Laws, Stereo Spread, and Surround Mixing

- **Pan Law:** How gain is distributed between channels; -3dB, -4.5dB, -6dB center common.
- **Stereo Spread:** Widen/narrow stereo image by phase/gain adjustments.
- **Surround Mixing:** Routing to 5.1/7.1, Ambisonic, or custom speaker layouts.

### 23.13.4 Gain Staging, Internal Metering, and Clip Detection

- **Gain Staging:** Maintain optimal levels throughout chain to prevent noise or clipping.
- **Metering:** Implement peak, RMS, LUFS meters; visual feedback in UI.
- **Clip Detection:** Track overages, alert user, optionally auto-trim.

## 23.14 Real-Time DSP Implementation Patterns

### 23.14.1 Block Processing, Lookahead, and Latency Compensation

- **Block Processing:** Always prefer buffer-by-buffer (not sample-by-sample) for efficiency.
- **Lookahead:** Used in brickwall limiters, some compressors; requires future buffer and latency compensation.
- **Latency Reporting:** FX must report delay to host/workstation for alignment.

### 23.14.2 Parameter Smoothing and Interpolation

- **Smoothing:** Apply 1-pole filter or Hermite/cubic interpolation to parameter changes.
- **Automation:** Interpolate per-sample for fast sweeps, per-block for slow moves.

### 23.14.3 SIMD, DSP Instructions, and Hardware Acceleration

- **SIMD:** Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SSE, NEON, AVX); process multiple samples at once.
- **DSP Cores:** Use MAC (multiply-accumulate), hardware filters, or vendor libraries (ARM CMSIS, TI DSPLib).
- **GPU Acceleration:** Rare but possible for convolution or FFT-heavy FX.

### 23.14.4 Embedded DSP Optimizations (ARM, SHARC, etc.)

- **Memory Layout:** Align data, use circular buffers, avoid cache misses.
- **Fixed-Point Math:** Use Q-format; saturating add/subtract; avoid division.
- **Interrupt Latency:** Keep audio ISR short, defer heavy work to low-priority tasks.

    idx = (idx + 1) % DLEN;
    return out;
}
```

#### 23.15.1.2 Biquad EQ (Python)

    def __init__(self, b, a):
        self.b = b
        self.a = a
        self.z = [0, 0]
    def process(self, x):
        y = self.b[0]*x + self.z[0]
        self.z[0] = self.b[1]*x - self.a[1]*y + self.z[1]
        self.z[1] = self.b[2]*x - self.a[2]*y
        return y
```
