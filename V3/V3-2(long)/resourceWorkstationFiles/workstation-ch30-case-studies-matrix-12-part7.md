## 30.101 Voice Card Deep Analysis: Analog Signal Integrity and Component Selection

### 30.101.1 CEM3340: Expo Converter, Linear and Nonlinear FM, Temperature Compensation

- **Expo Converter**:  
  - The CEM3340’s expo converter receives a summed CV (pitch, glide, mod, bend, etc.) and produces a current proportional to the exponential of the voltage.
  - Linear FM (pin 10): Accepts high frequency mod, can be used for clangorous FM or subtle vibrato. Nonlinear FM (via expo CV) gives classic analog detune.
  - **Temperature Compensation**:  
    - On-chip matched transistor pair, but for best results a thermistor (NTC) is used in the expo input resistor network, or a selected resistor with low tempco.
    - Drift <5 cents over 40°C if properly compensated.

### 30.101.2 Component Tolerances, Drift, and Aging Effects

- **Resistors**: 1% metal film for all critical CV summing and bias points.
- **Capacitors**: Polypropylene or C0G/NP0 ceramic for timing, S&H; avoid electrolytic in audio/CV.
- **Aging**:  
  - VCO and VCF scale drift: ~0.1–0.5% per decade.  
  - Potentiometer wipers can oxidize, leading to intermittent calibration errors.
  - Op-amp offset drift can cause S&H droop and VCA bias shift.

### 30.101.3 Audio Path Shielding, Star Ground, and Crosstalk Suppression

- **Star Ground**:  
  - Each voice card connects analog ground to star point at PSU, digital ground joined at one place only.
- **Shielding**:  
  - Audio out and CV lines shielded, especially near panel and card edge.
- **Crosstalk**:  
  - <60dB between voices at main out, tested with 0dBFS tone on one voice and silence on others.
  - PCB trace separation, ground guard traces, and short signal paths critical.

## 30.102 Nonlinearities in Analog Synthesis: Modeling, Measurement, and Calibration

### 30.102.1 VCO Waveform Symmetry, Offset, and Harmonic Content

- **Sawtooth**: Check for DC offset, edge curvature due to integrator leakage or cap ESR.
- **Triangle**: Symmetry sensitive to current source matching and switch speed.
- **Pulse**: PWM duty cycle accuracy; slew rate and edge speed affect harmonic content.
- **Measurement**:  
  - Use oscilloscope and FFT analyzer; THD <1% typical, but overdrive or FM increases harmonics.

### 30.102.2 VCF Nonlinearities: Resonance Clipping, Saturation, and Distortion

- **Resonance**:  
  - High Q can lead to soft or hard clipping at filter output; results in rich, sometimes unstable harmonics.
- **Saturation**:  
  - Input buffer may be overdriven, especially with multiple VCOs or feedback.  
  - Calibration ensures headroom, but musical distortion is sometimes desirable.

### 30.102.3 VCA/Pan OTA Linearity and Noise Floor

- **OTA Linearity**:  
  - CEM3360 is linear over ~60dB, with THD <0.05% at typical gain.
  - At low levels, offset and noise dominate; at high levels, slew rate limits may cause distortion.
- **Noise**:  
  - Output noise floor typically -90dB (A-weighted), but depends on PSU and grounding.

### 30.102.4 Practical Calibration: Tools, Procedures, and Digital Correction Tables

- **Tools**:  
  - DMM, oscilloscope, frequency counter, THD analyzer, signal generator.
- **Procedure**:  
  - For each voice, calibrate VCO scale/offset, VCF tracking, VCA unity gain.
  - Store correction factors in RAM; use lookup table in software for digital correction.
- **Digital Correction**:  
  - Correction table per voice, updated on auto-cal or service; ensures <1 cent pitch error and <0.1dB level error.

## 30.103 Polyphonic Stability: Voice Matching, Detuning, and Real-World Spread

### 30.103.1 Spread Algorithm: Digital Detune and Its Effect on Analog Voice Cohesion

- **Spread**:  
  - CPU applies small, pseudo-random offset to VCO pitch CV on each voice, based on user depth parameter.
- **Effect**:  
  - Wide spread: lush, chorused sound, some voices up to 20 cents apart.
  - Tight spread: more focused, but less “alive”.

#### 30.103.1.1 Spread Algorithm Example

```c
void apply_spread() {
    for (int v = 0; v < NUM_VOICES; ++v) {
        int8_t detune = spread_table[v] * user_spread_amt;
        voice_params[v].vco_pitch += detune;
    }
}
```

### 30.103.2 Voice-to-Voice Variation: How Analog Imperfections Add Musicality

- **No two voices identical**: Even after calibration, resistor/capacitor/IC variations mean pulse width, filter resonance, env shapes are a little different.
- **Result**:  
  - Polyphonic chords "breathe" and shift, especially with slow attack/release or modulated parameters.
  - Voice cycling (round-robin) ensures all imperfections are musically distributed.

### 30.103.3 Digital Correction vs. “Good” Imperfection: Striking the Balance

- **Calibration**:  
  - Digital correction tables keep pitch/level within spec, but do not erase small analog differences.
- **User Control**:  
  - “Slop” or “analog feel” parameter can reintroduce random drift, PWM, env timing for realism.
- **Best Practice**:  
  - Calibrate for accuracy, then modulate for musical effect.

## 30.104 Service Modes and Field Diagnostics: Practical Repair and Calibration

### 30.104.1 Voice Card Swap: Burn-In, Match, and Automated Test Sequences

- **Swap**:  
  - Remove faulty card, insert new/tested one. CPU detects presence on boot.
- **Burn-In**:  
  - New card run at full modulation range for 24h; verifies stability and detects early failures.
- **Automated Test**:  
  - Service mode cycles each parameter, measures response at out/testpoint, logs results to panel or via sysex.

### 30.104.2 In-Situ Calibration: Panel-Driven, Automated, and Manual Techniques

- **Panel-Driven**:  
  - User selects “calibrate” from service menu; instrument steps through each voice, requests user tuning on LCD.
- **Automated**:  
  - With frequency counter or ADC feedback, CPU can auto-tune and store corrections.
- **Manual**:  
  - Tech uses scope and test leads, adjusts trimmers, confirms with panel and audio output.

### 30.104.3 Data Logging, Voice Health History, and Predictive Maintenance

- **Logging**:  
  - Each calibration and fault event logged with timestamp in battery-backed RAM.
- **Voice Health History**:  
  - Panel displays voice age, last calibration, error count.
- **Predictive Maintenance**:  
  - Alerts user when voice/PSU/panel is likely to need service based on error trends.

## 30.105 C Code: Nonlinear Correction, Spread, and Calibration Algorithms

### 30.105.1 Nonlinear Correction Table Application

```c
#define CORRECTION_TABLE_SIZE 16
int16_t vco_corr[NUM_VOICES][CORRECTION_TABLE_SIZE]; // Per-voice per-octave

int16_t corrected_pitch(int v, int note) {
    int oct = note / 12;
    return voice_params[v].vco_pitch + vco_corr[v][oct];
}
```

### 30.105.2 Spread/Detune Algorithm Implementation

```c
int8_t spread_table[NUM_VOICES] = {0,4,-3,2,-2,1,-1,3,-4,2,0,-3}; // Example

void detune_voices(int amt) {
    for (int v = 0; v < NUM_VOICES; ++v)
        voice_params[v].vco_pitch += spread_table[v] * amt;
}
```

### 30.105.3 Automated Calibration Routine for Voice Cards

```c
void auto_calibrate() {
    for (int v = 0; v < NUM_VOICES; ++v) {
        for (int oct = 0; oct < CORRECTION_TABLE_SIZE; ++oct) {
            set_vco_pitch_cv(v, oct * 12);
            wait_stable();
            int freq = measure_frequency(v);
            vco_corr[v][oct] = ideal_freq[oct] - freq;
        }
    }
    save_correction_tables();
}
```

### 30.105.4 Voice Fault Logging and User Notification

```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t timestamp;
    uint8_t voice_num;
    char fault_type[16];
} voice_fault_t;

voice_fault_t fault_log[128];
uint8_t log_ptr = 0;

void log_voice_fault(int v, const char* type) {
    fault_log[log_ptr].timestamp = get_time();
    fault_log[log_ptr].voice_num = v;
    strncpy(fault_log[log_ptr].fault_type, type, 15);
    log_ptr = (log_ptr + 1) % 128;
    notify_user_fault(v, type);
}
```

## 30.106 Real-World Polyphonic Modular Patching: Design Patterns and Limitations

### 30.106.1 Per-Voice Routing and Macro Control

- **Routing**:  
  - Each voice has its own matrix, allowing for per-voice LFO phase, envelope times, or macro depth.
- **Macro**:  
  - Panel or MIDI control mapped to multiple destinations (e.g., morphing between two patches).

### 30.106.2 Musical Use Cases: Chord Detune, Voice Cycling, and Randomization

- **Chord Detune**:  
  - Each note of a chord sent to a different voice, each with unique detune and mod settings.
- **Voice Cycling**:  
  - Round-robin assignment ensures no voice is reused until all have played.
- **Randomization**:  
  - Small random offsets per voice on each note-on, for analog “slop”.

### 30.106.3 Limitations of the Matrix vs. Patch Cable Systems

- **No cross-voice audio patching**: All routing is per-voice; cannot route audio of voice 1 to filter of voice 2.
- **CV Update Rate**: Fast, but not true audio-rate for all destinations; high-speed mod best routed via audio path.
- **Fixed Topology**: VCO-VCF-VCA order cannot be changed without hardware mod.
