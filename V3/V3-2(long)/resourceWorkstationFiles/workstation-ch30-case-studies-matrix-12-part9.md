## 30.115 Automated Calibration Algorithms and Software Hooks

### 30.115.1 VCO, VCF, and VCA Digital Calibration Loop

- **VCO Calibration Loop**:
  - Initiate from service menu or on power-up (if auto-cal enabled).
  - For each voice, step pitch CV from lowest to highest (e.g., C1–C8); measure output frequency via frequency counter or ADC feedback.
  - Calculate deviation per step, store correction in per-voice table.
  - Use linear interpolation between steps for mid-note accuracy.
- **VCF Calibration Loop**:
  - Sweep cutoff CV, measure filter response at fixed input (white/pink noise or sine).
  - Track cutoff frequency and resonance peak; store correction for cutoff tracking and resonance symmetry.
- **VCA Calibration Loop**:
  - Set reference input (e.g., 1kHz sine at -12dB), sweep VCA CV from min to max.
  - Measure output level and linearity, store gain correction for each step.

#### 30.115.1.1 Pseudocode: VCO Calibration

```c
for (int v = 0; v < NUM_VOICES; v++) {
    for (int note = 0; note < 8; note++) {
        set_vco_pitch_cv(v, note_cv[note]);
        wait_settle();
        measured[v][note] = freq_counter(v);
    }
    calc_vco_corr(v, measured[v]);
}
```

### 30.115.2 Calibration Command Protocol, Panel UI, and Service Feedback

- **Panel UI**:
  - Service menu: “CALIBRATE VCO”, “CALIBRATE VCF”, “CALIBRATE VCA”.
  - LCD prompts for each step, e.g., “Insert probe on Voice 1 TP1”, “Press OK to continue”.
  - Progress, error, and pass/fail messages shown in real-time.
- **Command Protocol**:
  - Calibration steps can be triggered via panel, MIDI sysex, or test fixture serial commands.
  - Results logged to nonvolatile RAM and optionally exported via sysex.

### 30.115.3 Correction Table Storage, Flash/FRAM Use, and Patch Integration

- **Storage**:
  - Correction tables stored in battery-backed SRAM or FRAM, one per voice.
  - On patch recall, correction applied before pitch/filter/amp CV sent to DAC/mux.
- **Patch Integration**:
  - Per-voice correction is transparent to user patches; all patch edits maintain corrected accuracy.

## 30.116 Test Fixtures, Audio Analysis, and Repeatable Measurement

### 30.116.1 Custom Test Fixtures: Jigs, Bed-of-Nails, and Digital Probes

- **Bed-of-Nails**:

  - Automated scripts for stepping CV and logging corresponding measurements.

### 30.116.2 Audio Analysis Routines: FFT, SNR, THD, and Envelope Tracking

- **FFT Analysis**:
  - Audio output routed to analysis software (e.g., Audio Precision, custom Python/C code).
  - Calculate THD, SNR, spectrum for each voice.
- **Envelope Tracking**:
  - Trigger envelopes, record output, measure attack/decay/release time and shape.
  - Log deviations from ideal and update correction as needed.

### 30.116.3 Voice Consistency, Spread, and Reporting Standards

- **Consistency Check**:
  - After calibration, run all voices through a suite of audio and CV tests.
  - Generate report: per-voice pitch accuracy, filter tracking, VCA linearity, noise, and THD.
- **Reporting**:
  - Store last N test results for trend analysis and predictive maintenance.

## 30.117 Advanced Voice Analysis: Drift, Jitter, and Long-Term Stability

### 30.117.1 Drift Measurement: VCO, VCF, and VCA Over Time

- **VCO Drift**:
  - Measure frequency at C4, C8 over hours/days at different temperatures.
  - Log drift per hour and per °C, compare to factory spec.
- **VCF/Resonance Drift**:
  - Sweep cutoff, measure frequency and Q at fixed points, log over time.
- **VCA Gain Drift**:
  - Measure output level for fixed CV, log over operational hours.

### 30.117.2 Jitter Analysis: Pulse, Envelope, and LFO Stability

- **Pulse Jitter**:
  - Measure rising/falling edge timing of VCO pulse output over multiple cycles.
- **Envelope/LFO Jitter**:
  - Measure attack/decay/period for each trigger, log deviation from nominal.

### 30.117.3 Statistical Tools and Data Logging

- **Tools**:
  - Use rolling average, standard deviation, and trend detection in firmware.
  - Store logs in circular buffer in FRAM, download via sysex or USB.
- **Alerts**:
  - If drift/jitter exceeds set thresholds, notify user via panel and suggest recalibration.
