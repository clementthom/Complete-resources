## 3.21 Introduction: The User Interface in a Workstation

The user interface (UI) is how you interact with your workstation. It includes everything you touch, see, and use to control sounds, sequences, effects, and settings.  
A great UI makes your instrument fun and inspiring.  
A poor UI makes even the best sound engine frustrating!

This chapter explains, step-by-step and from the ground up, all the hardware used in a modern workstation UI, including:

- Touchscreens (how to choose, connect, and use them)
- Rotary encoders and potentiometers (for adjusting parameters and navigating)
- Buttons and switches (for triggers, menus, and transport)
- Pads with velocity/pressure sensitivity (for drums, note entry, expressive control)
- Displays (for feedback, parameter values, waveforms, menus)
- LEDs and lighting (status, feedback, visual cues)
- Control surface expansion (how to add more controls, design your own, and connect them safely)

## 3.22 What Is a UI Hardware Subsystem?

A **UI hardware subsystem** is the collection of all input and output devices wired to your workstation that you use to control it. These include:

- **Inputs:** Devices you touch or move (encoders, pads, buttons, touchscreens)
- **Outputs:** Devices that show you information (displays, LEDs, meters)
- **Feedback:** Devices that respond to your actions (lights, haptics, sound cues)

A professional workstation typically combines several different UI devices for the best experience.  
Each type has its own pros, cons, wiring, and software handling.

## 3.23 Touchscreens: Types, Choosing, and Connecting

### 3.23.1 What Is a Touchscreen?

A touchscreen is a display that also senses your finger or stylus.  
It lets you interact directly with menus, parameters, and even play virtual instruments.

#### Types of Touchscreens

| Type                | How It Works                  | Pros                    | Cons                    | Examples                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Resistive           | Layers pressed together       | Cheap, works w/gloves   | Less sensitive, no multi-touch | Waveshare 3.5" Pi LCD            |
| Capacitive          | Senses finger's electric field| Multi-touch, sharp      | Needs bare finger, pricier | Pi Foundation 7" Touch, phones   |
| Infrared/Optical    | Senses shadow of finger       | Any object, robust      | Bulky, rare in DIY      | Industrial panels                |

### 3.23.2 How to Choose a Touchscreen

- **Size:** 3.5"–7" is common for hardware synths.  
  Small: portable, less info. Large: more menus, bigger case.
- **Resolution:** Higher = crisper UI. 800x480 is a good minimum.
- **Type:** Capacitive recommended for multi-touch.  
  Resistive if you must use gloves or want stylus support.
- **Interface:** HDMI (video) + USB (touch), DSI, or SPI.
- **Pi Compatibility:** Most Pi screens are plug-and-play with recent Raspbian/Solus kernels.  
  Always check if drivers are available for your OS.

### 3.23.3 Connecting a Touchscreen to a Raspberry Pi

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Power off your Pi.**
2. **Mount the screen:**
   - For HDMI screens: Plug HDMI cable into Pi.  
   - For DSI screens: Attach ribbon cable to the DSI port.
   - For SPI screens: Plug into GPIO header.
3. **Connect touch interface:**
   - USB: Plug into any Pi USB port (usually auto-detects as HID).
   - SPI/I2C: Plug into GPIO pins; more setup needed.
4. **Power:** Many screens draw power from GPIO or need separate 5V feed.
5. **Boot up.**
6. **Install drivers (if needed):**  
   - For most HDMI/USB screens, no extra drivers needed.
   - For SPI, follow vendor instructions (may need dtoverlay in `/boot/config.txt`).
7. **Test with `xinput`/`evtest`/`lsusb` to see if touch is detected.**
8. **Calibrate:** If touch is offset, use `xinput_calibrator` or your UI toolkit's calibration.

### 3.23.4 Common Touchscreen Pitfalls

- **Power draw:** Large screens may crash Pi if underpowered. Use a beefy 5V supply!
- **Ghost touches/jitter:** Check for ground loops or poor-quality USB cables.
- **Driver mismatch:** Always check Linux kernel compatibility before buying.
- **Sunlight:** Most small screens are dim and hard to see outside.

## 3.24 Rotary Encoders: What They Are, How They Work, How to Use

### 3.24.1 What Is a Rotary Encoder?

A rotary encoder is a knob that turns endlessly, sending pulses as you rotate it.  
It’s used for adjusting values, scrolling, or stepping through options—unlike a potentiometer, it has no fixed start/end.

#### Encoder Types

| Type         | Features          | Use Case             | Example                      |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Mechanical   | Physical contacts | Cheap, common        | KY-040, Bourns PEC11         |
| Optical      | Light beams       | Smooth, no wear      | Expensive pro gear           |
| Magnetic     | Hall effect       | Ultra reliable       | Industrial, rare in DIY      |

### 3.24.2 How Encoders Work

- **2 output pins** (“A” and “B”) generate a quadrature signal (pattern of highs/lows).
- **Microcontroller (or Pi GPIO)** reads these pins and figures out the direction and amount turned.
- **Optional push switch:** Many encoders have a built-in push button (3rd pin).

### 3.24.3 How to Wire an Encoder to a Pi

**Parts needed:**  
- Rotary encoder (e.g., PEC11 or KY-040)
- 3 GPIO pins (two for rotation, one for switch)
- Pull-down resistors (10k) if not built into board

**Wiring Steps:**

1. **Connect GND on encoder to Pi GND.**
2. **Connect ‘A’ and ‘B’ pins to any two GPIOs.**
3. **Connect Switch pin (if any) to GPIO, with pull-down resistor.**
4. **Configure GPIO pins as inputs in your code (Python: `RPi.GPIO`, C: `wiringPi`).**
5. **Debounce in software:** Encoders are noisy; always filter out false steps.

**Tip:**  
If using many encoders, consider using I2C GPIO expanders (e.g., MCP23017).

### 3.24.4 Reading Encoders in Software

- **Polling:** Check pins in a loop (simplest, but wastes CPU).
- **Interrupts:** Use GPIO interrupts for efficient, responsive reading.
- **Encoder Libraries:** For Python, use `gpiozero` or `adafruit-circuitpython-rotaryio`.

**Pseudo-Code Example:**

```python
# Pseudo-code for polling encoder
last_a = read_gpio(A_PIN)
last_b = read_gpio(B_PIN)
while True:
    a = read_gpio(A_PIN)
    b = read_gpio(B_PIN)
    if a != last_a or b != last_b:
        # determine rotation direction
    last_a = a
    last_b = b
```

### 3.24.5 Encoder Mounting and Panel Design

- Use panel-mount encoders for durability.
- Add a washer/nut to prevent wobble.
- Consider encoder knobs: tall for main controls, short for secondary.
- Spacing: At least 20mm center-to-center for comfortable use.

### 3.24.6 Common Encoder Issues

- **Noisy/erratic readings:** Add capacitor (10–100nF) across A/B to GND, or use software debounce.
- **“Backwards” direction:** Swap A/B pins in software or hardware.
- **Missed steps:** Avoid long wire runs; use shielded cable if needed.

## 3.25 Buttons and Tactile Switches: Selection, Debouncing, Mounting

### 3.25.1 Types of Buttons

| Type              | Features                  | Use Case                       |
|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Tactile (momentary)| Clicky or soft, PCB-mount| Menus, triggers, navigation     |
| Latching (toggle) | Stays on/off             | Power, mode selection           |
| Illuminated       | Built-in LED             | Feedback, status, transport     |
| Capacitive        | Touch-based, no moving   | Sleek, modern UIs               |

### 3.25.2 Choosing Buttons

- **Feel:** Test samples! Some are clicky, some mushy, some silent.
- **Size:** 6x6mm (small), 12x12mm (medium), 16mm+ (arcade, transport).
- **Current Rating:** For logic-level use, almost any button is fine.
- **Color:** Use color coding for function—red (cancel/stop), green (play/OK), blue (special).

### 3.25.3 Wiring and Debouncing

- Connect one side to GPIO, other to GND (or 3.3V, depending on Pi config).
- Use a pull-down (or pull-up) resistor, often built into Pi.
- **Debouncing:** Mechanical switches “bounce,” causing multiple triggers.  
  *Always* debounce in software (10–50ms typical).

### 3.25.4 Mounting and Panel Layout

- Use PCB-mount for neatness, or wire to perfboard for prototypes.
- Panel-mount for heavy-use controls (transport, play/record).
- Label all buttons clearly (engraved, stickers, silkscreen, or color).

### 3.25.5 Special Button Features

- **Illuminated:** Connect LED cathode/anode to GPIO (with resistor!), can blink or show states.
- **Dual-action:** Some buttons have two depths (“half-press” and “full-press”).
- **Key matrix:** For many buttons, matrix scanning reduces GPIO usage (see pads section).

### 3.25.6 Common Button Issues

- **Sticky or unreliable:** Use high-quality brands (Omron, Alps, Bourns).
- **Ghosting in matrix:** Add diodes or use dedicated matrix ICs.
- **Unresponsive:** Check for bad solder joints, correct pull-up/down config.

## 3.26 Velocity/Pressure Pads: Basics, Sensing, and Integration

### 3.26.1 What Is a Velocity/Pressure Pad?

A pad that senses **how hard** and/or **how fast** you hit it—used for expressive drum/percussion or note entry.

#### Pad Types

| Type             | Sensing Method          | Pros                    | Cons                  | Example                 |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Piezo Disk       | Voltage spike          | Simple, cheap           | No true pressure, only hit | Akai, Roland drum pads  |
| Force Sensitive  | Resistance changes     | True pressure after touch| Needs ADC, pricier    | FSR 406, Sensitronics   |
| Capacitive       | Change in capacitance  | Sleek, no moving parts  | Harder to DIY         | Arturia, LinnStrument   |

### 3.26.2 Using Piezo Pads

- Wire piezo disk between analog input and ground.
- Add series resistor (1MΩ) and protection diode.
- Use op-amp buffer for best results.
- Read with fast ADC (sample at 5–10kHz); detect peak value to get velocity.

### 3.26.3 Using Force-Sensitive Resistors (FSR)

- FSR forms a voltage divider with fixed resistor.
- Connect divider to ADC pin.
- FSR is “infinite” resistance at rest, drops with pressure.
- Read value in code, scale to MIDI velocity or CC.

### 3.26.4 Matrix Scanning Pads

- For 4x4, 8x8 grids: Save GPIOs by wiring as rows/columns.
- Scan by setting each row high, reading columns.
- For velocity: Use analog multiplexers (e.g., CD4051) or I2C ADCs (e.g., ADS1115).

### 3.26.5 Pad Mounting Tips

- Use foam/rubber backing for bounce and feel.
- Secure with double-sided tape or screws.
- Spacing: At least 20mm for fingers, 30mm for sticks.

### 3.26.6 Software Reading

- Filter out noise with moving average or median filter.
- For velocity, measure peak value within a short window after pad is struck.
- For aftertouch, measure sustained pressure and send as MIDI CC.

- **LCD:** For simple data, menus, retro look.
- **HDMI/DSI:** For full graphical UI, touch.

### 3.27.3 Connecting Displays

- **I2C/SPI:** Wire to Pi GPIO header (check voltage—most OLEDs are 3.3V).
- **HDMI:** Use Pi’s HDMI port; auto-detects at boot.
- **DSI:** Flat ribbon to DSI port (Pi-specific).
- **Backlight:** Some LCDs need separate 5V for backlight.

### 3.27.4 Display Mounting

- Use standoffs or brackets for large screens.
- For OLED/LCD, mount flush with panel cutout.
- Label display area on panel for clarity.

### 3.27.5 Software Setup

- **I2C/SPI:** Use libraries like `luma.oled` (Python), `ssd1306` (C/C++).
- **HDMI:** Use standard display server (X11, Wayland), or run UI directly on framebuffer.

### 3.27.6 Common Display Issues

- **“No display”:** Check power, wiring, contrast, and address (I2C).
- **Corrupted graphics:** Check for loose connections, try slower SPI/I2C speed.
- **Backlight but no image:** Check contrast/brightness settings.

- **RGB:** 3 GPIOs (or single for addressable), one resistor per color.
- **Bargraph:** Multiplexed or with dedicated driver IC (e.g., LM3914).
- **Neopixel:** Data in to GPIO, Vcc (5V), GND. Use level shifter for 3.3V Pi logic.

### 3.28.3 Driving Many LEDs

- Use shift registers (74HC595) for more LEDs with fewer pins.
- PWM for dimming (software or hardware PWM).
- For hundreds of LEDs, use addressable types (WS2812, SK6812).

### 3.28.4 Panel Design

- Place LEDs near relevant controls (encoders, pads) for feedback.
- Use light pipes for indicators through thick panels.
- Label all LEDs with function (color, icon, or text).

### 3.28.5 Software Control

- Blink for activity, solid for state, fade for transitions.
- Use libraries: `rpi_ws281x` (Python/C), `Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel`.

### 3.28.6 Common LED Issues

- **No light:** Check polarity, resistor value, GPIO setup.
- **Dim/flicker:** Insufficient power, bad wiring, PWM conflict.

## 3.29 Control Surface Expansion: Adding/Designing Your Own

### 3.29.1 Why Expand?

- More controls = more hands-on power!
- Add more pads, encoders, faders, or custom controls.
- Modular design allows you to tailor the UI to your workflow.

### 3.29.2 Expansion Methods

- **GPIO:** Direct wire, limited by available pins.
- **I2C/SPI:** Use GPIO expanders (MCP23017, PCF8574) or ADCs (MCP3008, ADS1115).
- **USB:** Plug in MIDI controller (many are class-compliant).
- **HATs/Shields:** Stackable boards conforming to Pi HAT spec.

### 3.29.3 Example: Adding a 16-Encoder Expansion

- Use MCP23017 I2C GPIO expander.
- Wire 8 encoders (16 pins) to one chip.
- Address up to 8 chips per I2C bus (up to 64 encoders!).
- Use existing libraries to scan and decode.

### 3.29.4 Example: Adding an 8x8 Pad Grid

- Use multiplexers (CD4051, CD74HC4067) to scan rows/columns.
- For velocity, use FSRs and analog multiplexers to scan all signals into a single ADC.
- Use matrix scanning code (see Teensy MIDI controller projects for reference).

### 3.29.5 Custom Shields

## 3.30 Wiring, Power, and Cable Management

### 3.30.1 Wiring Basics

- Use stranded wire for panel to PCB (flexible, less likely to break).
- Use ribbon cable for neat multi-pin runs (e.g., button matrices).
- Keep analog and digital wires separate.

### 3.30.2 Power Distribution

- Power high-current devices (LEDs, screens) from main 5V rail, not GPIO.
- Use separate regulator for noisy loads if possible.

### 3.30.3 Cable Management

- Bundle wires with zip ties or cable sleeves.
- Label all connectors (especially for removable panels).
- Allow slack for panel removal/servicing.

### 3.30.4 Shielding

- For long runs or noisy environments, use shielded cable.
- Ground shield at one end only to avoid ground loops.

---

## 3.31 Assembly Tips and Common Mistakes

- **Test all controls before panel assembly.**
- Use standoffs for PCBs to prevent shorts.
- Don’t overtighten panel nuts (can crack plastic or PCB).
- Double-check orientation on LEDs and encoders.
- Use hot glue or threadlocker for connectors that may loosen over time.
- For “dead” controls, check solder joints, continuity, and pin mapping.

---

## 3.32 Testing and Troubleshooting Your UI Hardware

### 3.32.1 Initial Testing

- Power up with only UI controls connected.
- Use test firmware to blink LEDs, read button presses, display info.
- Check for shorts with multimeter before applying power.

### 3.32.2 Debugging Checklist

- **Nothing works:** Check power to all boards.
- **Some controls dead:** Check wiring, GPIO numbers, and software mapping.
- **Ghost presses/noise:** Add software debounce, check for floating inputs.
- **Flickering display/LEDs:** Check supply voltage under load.

### 3.32.3 Long-Term Reliability

- Use quality connectors and wire; avoid “dupont” jumper wires for permanent builds.
- Recheck all screws, nuts, and panel alignment after first week of use.
