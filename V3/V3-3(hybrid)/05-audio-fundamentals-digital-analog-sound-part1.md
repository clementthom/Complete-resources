## 1. Introduction: Why Audio Fundamentals Matter for Synth Builders

Every electronic musical instrument is, at its heart, a machine for controlling sound. Understanding audio fundamentals is essential for designing, building, debugging, and ultimately enjoying your synthesizer. Many hobby synths fail to sound “professional” because of subtle mistakes in audio signal flow, incorrect handling of digital audio, or a lack of attention to analog detail.

In this chapter, you’ll learn the theoretical and practical principles you need to:
- Design clean, musical signal chains
- Avoid noise, distortion, and digital artifacts
- Integrate analog and digital modules (the core of hybrid synths)
- Debug and measure audio signals with real tools
- Understand why classics like the Emulator III and Synclavier sound so good

**Take your time with this chapter—mastery here will pay huge dividends as you progress into coding and hardware design.**

## 2. The Nature of Sound

### 2.1 What is Sound? (Physics Perspective)

**Sound** is a vibration that travels through a medium (usually air) and is perceived by our ears. In technical terms, it’s a longitudinal pressure wave.

- **Pressure variation**: Air molecules are compressed and rarefied as the sound wave passes.
- **Frequency (f)**: Number of cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). Determines pitch.
- **Amplitude (A)**: Height of the wave, corresponds to loudness.
- **Wavelength (λ)**: Distance between two corresponding points in adjacent cycles.
- **Speed (v)**: In air at room temperature, about 343 m/s.

#### Mathematical Description

A simple sine wave:
```math
y(t) = A \cdot \sin(2\pi f t + \phi)
```
- `A` = amplitude
- `f` = frequency
- `t` = time
- `φ` = phase (offset in radians)

### 2.2 Sound Waves: Frequency, Amplitude, Phase

- **Frequency**: Human hearing ranges from ~20 Hz (low bass) to ~20,000 Hz (high treble).
    - Musical notes are defined by frequency (A4 = 440 Hz).
- **Amplitude**: Determines loudness, measured in decibels (dB).
- **Phase**: The starting point of the wave, important in how waves combine (constructive/destructive interference).

### 2.3 Waveforms and Timbre

- **Timbre**: The “color” or quality of a sound, determined by its spectrum (harmonics).
- **Waveforms**:
    - **Sine**: Pure tone, only fundamental frequency.
    - **Square**: Odd harmonics, hollow/woody sound.
    - **Triangle**: Odd harmonics, softer than square.
    - **Sawtooth**: All harmonics, bright and buzzy.

#### Why do different waveforms sound different?
- Because of their **harmonic content**: The mix of frequencies above the fundamental.

### 2.4 Acoustic to Electric: Microphones, Pickups, and Line Levels

- Microphones and pickups convert pressure waves to voltage.
- **Line level**: The standard voltage level for audio equipment (~1V peak-to-peak).
- Synth outputs should match line level for proper interfacing with mixers, speakers, etc.

## 3. The Human Ear and Perception

### 3.1 Hearing Range, Loudness, and Pitch

- **Frequency range**: 20 Hz – 20 kHz (varies by age, health)
- **Pitch**: Perceived frequency; musical notes are spaced logarithmically.
- **Loudness**: Perceived amplitude; measured in dB SPL (sound pressure level).

### 3.2 Psychoacoustics: Why Synths Sound “Good” or “Bad”

- **Masking**: Loud sounds can hide quieter ones at similar frequencies.
- **Beating**: Two close frequencies produce a “beating” effect (useful in synths for chorus/unison).
- **Critical bands**: Ear groups frequencies into “bands”; too much energy in one band can sound harsh.
- **Nonlinearity**: Subtle distortion in analog circuits can sound “pleasant” (tube warmth, transistor crunch).

### 3.3 Harmonics, Overtones, and Musical Intervals

- **Harmonics**: Integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.
    - 1st harmonic: Fundamental (f)
    - 2nd harmonic: 2f (octave)
    - 3rd harmonic: 3f (octave + fifth)
- **Overtones**: Any frequency higher than the fundamental, may include non-integer relationships.
- **Intervals**: The ratio of frequencies between notes (e.g., an octave is 2:1).

#### Why this matters for synths:
- Synth designers shape the harmonic content to create musically useful timbres.
- Filters, waveshaping, and modulation all alter the overtone structure.

## 4. Signal Flow in Synthesizers

### 4.1 Signal Chain: Oscillator → Envelope → Filter → Amplifier → Output

A typical analog or hybrid synth signal path:

```
[Oscillator] → [Mixer] → [Filter] → [VCA/Envelope] → [Output]
```

- **Oscillator**: Generates the raw waveform (sine, square, saw, etc.)
- **Mixer**: Combines signals from multiple oscillators or sources.
- **Filter (VCF)**: Shapes the frequency content (low-pass, high-pass, etc.)
- **VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier)**: Adjusts amplitude, usually via an envelope generator.
- **Output**: Drives speakers, headphones, or recording gear.

### 4.2 Block Diagrams (Classical and Hybrid Synths)

**Analog Example (Minimoog):**

```
VCO1 →\
VCO2 →-->[Mixer]→[VCF]→[VCA]→[Output]
VCO3 →/
```

**Hybrid Example (Emulator III):**

```
[Digital Oscillator/Sample Playback]→[Analog Filter]→[VCA]→[Output]
```

- **Digital front-end**: Generates/plays back waveforms or samples.
- **Analog back-end**: Applies filtering, amplification, and output buffering.

### 4.3 Signal Levels, Impedance, and Interfacing Modules

- **Line level** (typical synth output): ~1V RMS (~2.8V peak-to-peak).
- **Eurorack modular level**: ±5V or ±10V.
- **Impedance**: Must match input and output for proper signal transfer (low output impedance, high input impedance).
    - Typical synth output impedance: 1kΩ or less.
    - Typical input impedance: 10kΩ or higher.

### 4.4 Noise, Distortion, and Headroom

- **Noise**: Unwanted random signal, usually from components or power supply.
- **Distortion**: Any unwanted change in waveform (can be desirable in moderation).
- **Headroom**: The margin between the normal operating level and the maximum level before distortion/clipping.

## 5. Analog Audio: Circuits and Concepts

### 5.1 Analog Voltage and Current

- Audio signals are represented as **voltages** that vary over time, typically ±5V or ±10V for synths.
- **Current** is usually low (milliamps), except for driving speakers.

### 5.2 Op-Amps, Passive/Active Filters, and VCAs

- **Op-Amps**: The core building block for analog synth circuits (buffers, mixers, filters, VCAs).
- **Passive filter**: Uses resistors and capacitors; simple but limited control.
- **Active filter**: Uses op-amps for sharper response and voltage control.
- **Voltage-Controlled Amplifier (VCA)**: Changes gain in response to a control voltage (CV).

#### Example: Simple RC Low-pass Filter

```math
f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi RC}
```
- `f_c` = cutoff frequency
- `R` = resistance (ohms)
- `C` = capacitance (farads)

#### Example: Op-Amp Buffer

Prevents signal loss when connecting modules; high input impedance, low output impedance.

### 5.3 Signal-to-Noise Ratio and “Warmth”

- **SNR**: Ratio of desired signal to background noise. Higher is better (measured in dB).
- **Warmth**: Subjective quality, often due to low-level harmonic distortion, gentle clipping, and analog filtering.

### 5.4 Analog Circuit Nonlinearity: Saturation, Clipping, Character

- **Saturation**: Gradual “soft” limiting of signal; often pleasing.
- **Clipping**: Abrupt cutoff of signal peaks; harsh, but can be musical in small doses.
- **Character**: Each analog circuit imparts its own sonic fingerprint, due to component tolerances, aging, and design.
