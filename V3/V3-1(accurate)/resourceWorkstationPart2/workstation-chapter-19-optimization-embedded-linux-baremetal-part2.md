## 5. Real-Time Audio and Scheduling (continued)

### 5.1 What Makes Audio Real-Time?

- **Definition:**  
  Real-time audio means sound is generated, processed, and delivered fast enough that users don't perceive any delay or glitches.
- **Why so hard on embedded?**  
  - Limited CPU, memory, and IO speed.
  - Other system activities can interrupt audio—must design for guaranteed CPU and IO time.

### 5.2 Audio Buffer Sizes, Latency, and Dropouts

- **Buffer size:**  
  - Determines how much audio is processed in one go (e.g., 64, 128, 256 samples).
  - Smaller buffer = lower latency, but higher risk of underruns (dropouts) if CPU can't keep up.
- **Latency:**  
  - The time from input (e.g., key press) to output (sound).
  - Typical pro audio: <10ms is good. <5ms is great for synths.
- **Dropouts:**  
  - Occur when buffer isn't filled in time; results in clicks, pops, or silence.
  - Must monitor and log—all dropouts are bugs!

### 5.3 Scheduling Audio Threads

- **Priorities:**  
  - Use real-time scheduling (e.g., SCHED_FIFO on Linux).
  - Audio thread must always run before UI/network/background.
- **CPU Isolation:**  
  - On multi-core, dedicate a core to audio (CPU affinity).
- **Watch for:**  
  - Kernel or driver activities that can block audio (e.g., SD card writes, USB interrupts).

### 5.4 Interrupts, Timers, and Reliable MIDI/Audio Timing

- **Interrupts:**  
  - Used for audio IO, MIDI, clocks.
  - Keep ISRs (interrupt service routines) minimal—defer work to main loop if possible.
- **Timers:**  
  - Use hardware timers for precise scheduling (e.g., 1ms tick for audio callback).
- **Jitter:**  
  - Variability in callback timing causes audio artifacts; must minimize.

### 5.5 Avoiding Priority Inversion and Deadlocks

- **Priority inversion:**  
  - When audio thread waits on a lower-priority thread holding a lock.
- **Solution:**  
  - Minimize locking in audio thread, use lock-free queues or ringbuffers.
- **Deadlocks:**  
  - Two threads waiting on each other—design carefully, avoid circular dependencies.

### 5.6 Practice: Writing a Real-Time Safe Audio Callback

- **Key rules:**
    - No malloc/free or file IO in the audio callback.
    - No locks, blocking calls, or long computations.
    - Use ringbuffers or lock-free FIFOs for data exchange.
- **Example (pseudo-C):**
    ```c
    void audio_callback(float *out, int nframes) {
        for (int i=0; i<nframes; ++i) {
            out[i] = synth_render_next_sample();
        }
        // Signal UI thread via ringbuffer if needed
    }
    ```

## 6. Storage and Filesystem Optimization

### 6.1 Choosing a Filesystem

- **ext4:**  
  - Robust, journaling, good for SD/eMMC, but needs proper unmount on power loss.
- **FAT32/exFAT:**  
  - Universal, for removable storage (USB, SD).
- **JFFS2/YAFFS2/UBIFS:**  
  - For raw flash, wear leveling, power-loss safe.
- **Best practice:**  
  - Use journaling FS for system, FAT for user patches/samples, flash FS for internal NAND.

### 6.2 Wear Leveling, Flash Management, and Data Integrity

- **Wear leveling:**  
  - Spreads writes across flash to prevent early failure.
- **Management:**  
  - Avoid frequent small writes; batch or cache to RAM.
- **Data integrity:**  
  - Use checksums, verify writes, handle power failure gracefully.

### 6.3 Fast Sample/Patch Load

- **Caching:**  
  - Keep most-used samples in RAM or preload at boot.
- **Direct mapping:**  
  - Use mmap to avoid copying files into buffers.
- **Async load:**  
  - Preload next patch/sample while current is playing.

### 6.4 Reducing Write Amplification and Fragmentation

- **Write amplification:**  
  - Flash must erase whole blocks—avoid frequent rewrites.
- **Fragmentation:**  
  - Remove unused files, periodically defragment (if FS supports).
- **Buffer writes:**  
  - Use RAM buffers to batch small writes.

### 6.5 Practice: Benchmarking Filesystem Performance

- **Tools:**  
  `dd`, `hdparm`, or custom C code to measure read/write speed and latency.
- **Tasks:**  
  - Measure sample load time, patch save latency.
  - Try different filesystems/configurations.

## 7. Networking and Protocol Efficiency

### 7.1 Lightweight Networking Stacks

- **lwIP/uIP:**  
  - Small, fast TCP/IP for MCUs/RTOS.
- **Linux net stack:**  
  - Full-featured, more overhead, but needed for complex protocols.
- **ZeroConf (Bonjour, mDNS):**  
  - For discovery of workstations on a network without manual config.

### 7.2 Optimizing for MIDI over IP, OSC, Remote UI

- **Buffering:**  
  - Use small, fixed buffers for MIDI/OSC messages.
- **Packet size:**  
  - Keep packets small for low latency.
- **Latency:**  
  - Minimize roundtrips; use event-driven, not polled, protocols.

### 7.3 Service Discovery and Connection Management

- **Discovery:**  
  - Devices announce themselves and listen for others (e.g., for network sync or remote control).
- **Management:**  
  - Drop/reconnect gracefully, handle lost packets, use timeouts.

### 7.4 Practice: Measuring Network Latency

- **Tools:**  
  `ping`, `iperf`, or custom UDP echo test.
- **Tasks:**  
  - Measure latency from remote UI to device.
  - Try wired vs. wireless, different protocols.

## 8. Graphics and UI Performance

### 8.1 Choosing a Graphics Stack

- **Framebuffer:**  
  - Direct pixel access, minimal dependencies, basic for small displays.
- **DRM/KMS:**  
  - Modern Linux graphics, supports acceleration, HDMI.
- **OpenGL ES:**  
  - For fast, animated, hardware-accelerated UIs.
- **Qt, LVGL, TouchGFX:**  
  - High-level UI toolkits for complex, touch-driven UIs.

### 8.2 Double Buffering, Partial Updates, Tear-Free UI

- **Double buffering:**  
  - Draw to off-screen buffer, then swap; avoids flicker.
- **Partial updates:**  
  - Only redraw changed regions (rectangles).
- **Tear-free:**  
  - Synchronize buffer swap to display refresh (vsync).

### 8.3 Touch/Control Latency and Debounce

- **Fast scan:**  
  - Poll touch/controls at high rate (1ms typical).
- **Debounce:**  
  - Ignore spurious transitions; combine hardware and software debounce.
- **Feedback:**  
  - Immediate UI response to every touch/knob for best user feel.

### 8.4 Resource Management: Fonts, Images, Animations

- **Preload:**  
  - Load fonts/images at startup; avoid on-the-fly loads.
- **Compression:**  
  - Use compressed formats (PNG, RLE) for images.
- **Animations:**  
  - Use hardware acceleration where possible, avoid blocking UI thread.

### 8.5 Practice: Profiling UI Frame Rate

- **Tools:**  
  Built-in toolkit profilers, `top`, external camera at 60/120fps.
- **Tasks:**  
  - Measure frame rate and input latency.
  - Profile slow screens, optimize redraws.

## 9. Power Management and Thermal Optimization

### 9.1 Dynamic Frequency and Voltage Scaling (DVFS)

- **DVFS:**  
  - CPU lowers clock/voltage when idle; saves power, reduces heat.
- **Linux:**  
  - Use `cpufreq` governors (ondemand, performance, powersave).

### 9.2 Sleep, Suspend, and Wakeup

- **Sleep:**  
  - Device enters low-power state, keeps RAM.
- **Suspend:**  
  - Stops CPU, keeps state in RAM or flash.
- **Wakeup:**  
  - Fast resume on button press, timer, or MIDI event.

### 9.3 Measuring Power Draw and Battery Impact

- **Tools:**  
  USB power meters, battery gas gauge, oscilloscope for spikes.
- **Tasks:**  
  - Measure idle, peak, and average power.
  - Profile wake/sleep transitions.

### 9.4 Thermal Management: Sensors, Throttling, and Cooling

- **Sensors:**  
  - Monitor CPU, board, and ambient temp.
- **Throttling:**  
  - Reduce CPU speed or disable features if too hot.
- **Cooling:**  
  - Heatsinks, fans, or passive airflow as needed.

### 9.5 Practice: Power Profiling on an Embedded Board

- **Measure:**  
  - Power at idle, under load, and during sleep.
- **Optimize:**  
  - Disable unused peripherals, dim display, optimize code for fewer wakeups.

## 10. Security, Updates, and System Integrity

### 10.1 Secure Boot, Signed Images, and Firmware Updates

- **Secure boot:**  
  - Bootloader verifies kernel and app signatures to prevent tampering.
- **Signed images:**  
  - All firmware and update files must be signed and checked before install.
