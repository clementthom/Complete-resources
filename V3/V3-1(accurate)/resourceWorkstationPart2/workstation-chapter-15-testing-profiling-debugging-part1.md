## 1. Introduction to Testing, Profiling, and Debugging

### 1.1 Why Test, Profile, and Debug?

- **Testing** helps you check if your code or hardware works as intended. Think of it like tuning an instrument before a performance.
- **Profiling** is about measuring how fast your code runs or how much memory it uses. This is like checking if your music plays smoothly with no hiccups.
- **Debugging** is what you do when something goes wrong—a note is off, or the system crashes—and you need to figure out why and how to fix it.

**In a workstation, these skills keep your music, UI, and hardware running reliably, even as the system gets more complex.**

### 1.2 Key Terms and Basic Concepts

- **Test case:** A specific check you write to see if a part of your system works.
- **Bug:** An error or problem in code or hardware.
- **Profile:** A measurement of how a program uses resources (time, memory).
- **Debugger:** A tool to examine your program while it runs, step by step.
- **Regression:** When an old bug comes back after a change.
- **Unit:** The smallest piece of code you want to test (often a function).

### 1.3 The Embedded Music Workstation Context

- **Embedded:** Means the computer is inside another device (like your synth or sampler), not a full PC.
- **Constraints:** Less memory, less processing power, sometimes no display or keyboard.
- **Interfaces:** Buttons, knobs, displays, audio jacks, MIDI ports.
- **Risks:** Real-time failures (audio dropout), hardware bugs (bad solder joint), and software bugs (crashes, hangs).

### 1.4 Beginner Mindset: How to Approach Problems

- **Curiosity:** Ask “why” when something breaks or behaves unexpectedly.
- **Patience:** Debugging often takes time; try one thing at a time.
- **Systematic:** Change only one thing before testing again.
- **Notes:** Keep a log of what you tried and what happened.

## 2. Types of Testing in Embedded Systems

### 2.1 Manual Testing: What, Why, and How

- **Definition:** You, a human, check if a button works, if the screen shows the right thing, or if audio comes out.  
- **How:** Push buttons, turn knobs, watch lights, listen to sound.
- **When:** Early development, or when you don’t have automation.
- **Pros/Cons:**  
  - + No setup needed, good for quick checks.  
  - – Tedious, inconsistent, can miss subtle errors.

### 2.2 Automated Testing: Benefits and Challenges

- **Definition:** Computer runs the tests for you—many times, very fast.
- **How:** Write scripts or code that check outputs, verify signals, and catch failures.
- **Benefits:**  
  - Runs every time you make a change.
  - Catches things you might forget to check.
  - Good for teams or big projects.
- **Challenges:**  
  - Takes time to set up.
  - Harder when hardware is involved.

### 2.3 Unit Testing: The Smallest Building Block

- **Definition:** Test one small part (like a function) in isolation.
- **Goal:** If every small part works, the whole system is more likely to work.
- **Tools:** Ceedling/Unity (C), Google Test (C++), pytest (Python), etc.
- **Example:**  
  - Function to add two numbers: Write a test that checks if add(2,3) == 5.

### 2.4 Integration Testing: Making Parts Work Together

- **Definition:** Test two or more parts together (e.g., button reads + LED lights).
- **Goal:** Catch bugs that unit tests miss (e.g., wrong wire, missed connection).
- **Example:**  
  - Press a button, expect a sound to play.

### 2.5 System and Acceptance Testing

- **System Test:** Does the whole workstation work as a unit? (e.g., boot up, load patch, play note)
- **Acceptance Test:** Does the system do what the user wants? (e.g., “Can I record and playback a sequence?”)
- **Who runs these?** Usually the developer (system), and then a user, tester, or customer (acceptance).

### 2.6 Regression Testing: Preventing Old Bugs from Returning

- **Definition:** Re-run old tests after changes to be sure you didn’t break things.
- **Importance:** As code grows, you forget details; regression tests protect against “fixing one thing, breaking another.”
- **Example:**  
  - A bug where a knob used to control the wrong parameter. After fixing, keep a test so it never happens again.

### 2.7 Practice: Writing and Running Your First Simple Test

- **Example:**  
  1. Write a function: `int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }`
  2. Write a unit test:  
      - “If I add 2 + 3, I should get 5.”
  3. Run test:  
      - If it passes, great! If it fails, fix it.

## 3. Tools and Environments for Testing

### 3.1 Hardware Test Setups vs. Software Simulators

- **Hardware testing:**  
  - Real device, real buttons, real audio.
  - May use test jigs (special boards to press buttons, read voltages, etc).
- **Software simulation:**  
  - Run embedded code on your PC or in a virtual device.
  - Simulate inputs/outputs (e.g., fake MIDI, fake knob turns).
- **When to use:**  
  - Hardware for final confidence; simulation for fast, safe, and repeatable checks.

### 3.2 Introduction to Test Frameworks

- **What is a test framework?**  
  - A library or tool that helps organize, run, and report on tests.
- **Beginner-friendly examples:**  
  - Ceedling/Unity: C code, very popular in embedded.
  - pytest: Python, easy for scripts and fast prototyping.
  - ArduinoUnit: For Arduino projects.
- **How to use:**  
  - Write functions that start with “test_”. The framework finds and runs them.
  - Tests report “pass” or “fail”; you get a summary at the end.

### 3.3 Test Benches and Test Jigs (Physical and Virtual)

- **Test bench:**  
  - A setup with your device, power, cables, and maybe measurement equipment (oscilloscope, logic analyzer).
- **Test jig:**  
  - A special fixture (hardware) for mass-testing buttons, screens, or connectors.
- **Virtual test bench:**  
  - Emulated hardware, or scripts simulating button presses, MIDI notes, etc.

### 3.4 Test Data: Inputs, Outputs, and Golden References

- **Test input:**  
  - What you send to your code or device (e.g., MIDI note, button press).
- **Expected output:**  
  - What you expect to happen (e.g., LED turns on, audio buffer contains a C4 note).
- **Golden reference:**  
  - A “known good” file or result to compare against (e.g., waveform, image, text output).

### 3.5 Practice: Setting Up a Simple Test Project

- Create a new folder for your tests.
- Write a few test cases (functions).
- Use a framework to run them.
- Check the output—see which pass and which fail.

## 4. Profiling: Measuring Performance the Simple Way

### 4.1 What Is Profiling? Why Do We Measure?

- **Profiling** means measuring how long your code takes (speed), or how much memory it uses (space).
- **Why bother?**  
  - To avoid audio glitches, slow screens, or crashes from running out of memory.
  - To find “hot spots” (slowest parts) that need improvement.

### 4.2 Types of Profiling: Manual Timing, Sampling, Instrumentation

- **Manual timing:**  
  - Use a stopwatch, or insert code like `start = timer(); ... end = timer(); print(end-start);`.
- **Sampling:**  
  - Tool “samples” where the CPU is working, many times per second, to see where most time is spent.
- **Instrumentation:**  
  - Insert code at function entry/exit to measure how often/how long each function runs.

### 4.3 Tools for Beginners

- **printf/logging:**  
  - Print a message with a timestamp before and after a block of code.
- **On-chip timers:**  
  - Many microcontrollers have timers/counters that you can read.
- **Simple profilers:**  
  - Some IDEs or debuggers have built-in profiling (e.g., Segger Ozone, STM32CubeIDE).

### 4.4 How to Interpret Profiling Data (Looking for Slow Parts)

- **Look for:**  
  - Functions that use the most time.
  - Parts that get called too often.
  - Unexpected delays (e.g., waiting for IO, waiting for user input).
- **What next?**  
  - Try to optimize (make faster) only what needs it—don’t waste time on code that runs rarely.

### 4.5 Practice: Profiling a Simple Audio Processing Loop

- Write a loop that processes 1000 audio samples.
- Insert timing code before and after the loop.
- Print or display the time taken.
- Try optimizing (e.g., use a simpler algorithm, unroll the loop) and measure the difference.

## 5. Debugging: Finding and Fixing Problems

### 5.1 What Is a Bug? Types of Bugs in Embedded Systems

- **Bug:**  
  - Any error or problem that makes your code or hardware behave incorrectly.
- **Common embedded bugs:**  
  - Logic errors: wrong calculation, bad condition.
  - Timing errors: too slow, too fast, bad order.
  - Hardware interface: pin mapping wrong, bad solder joint.
  - Memory: buffer overrun, stack overflow, memory leak.
  - Real-time: missed deadline, audio glitch, unresponsive UI.

### 5.2 Basic Debugging Workflow: Observation, Hypothesis, Testing, and Fix

1. **Observation:**  
   - Notice something is wrong (e.g., button doesn’t work, sound is distorted).
2. **Hypothesis:**  
   - Guess what might be causing the problem (e.g., “Maybe the button pin is wrong.”).
3. **Testing:**  
   - Change or measure something to check your guess.
4. **Fix:**  
   - Change code or hardware, verify if the problem goes away.
5. **Repeat:**  
   - If not fixed, repeat with new hypothesis.

### 5.3 The Role of Logging and Print Statements

- **Logging:**  
  - Print messages to screen, serial port, or file.
  - Helps you “see” what is happening inside your code.
- **Best practices:**  
  - Print important variables at key steps.
  - Don’t flood with too many messages—can slow down real-time code.

### 5.4 Using Simple Debuggers (GDB, Segger Ozone, MCU debuggers)

- **What is a debugger?**  
  - A tool to pause your program, examine values, step through code, and set breakpoints.
- **Beginner steps:**  
  - Set a breakpoint at a suspicious line.
  - Run code until it stops at the breakpoint.
  - Check variable values—do they match your expectations?
  - Step through code one line at a time.
- **Popular tools:**  
  - GDB: command line, very powerful, works for most MCUs, Linux, etc.
  - Segger Ozone: GUI for Segger J-Link debuggers.
  - MCU vendor IDEs: STM32CubeIDE, MPLAB X, Atmel Studio.

### 5.5 Common Mistakes and Beginner Pitfalls

- **Changing too many things at once.**
- **Forgetting to save or rebuild code before testing.**
- **Not checking power, connections, or the basics.**
- **Trusting test results without double-checking test inputs/outputs.**
- **Overlooking intermittent (random) bugs—test multiple times.**

### 5.6 Practice: Debugging a Failing Button Input

- Write code to read a button (digital input).
- Simulate or wire up the button.
- If it doesn’t work, print/log the button state.
- Use a debugger to check the pin value in real time.
- Try swapping pins, checking wiring, and re-flashing.
