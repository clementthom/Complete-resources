- **Sea freight:**  
  Cheapest per kg, slowest (weeks to months), best for large, heavy, or non-urgent shipments. Requires containerization and port handling.
- **Rail:**  
  Used mostly in Eurasia, balances cost/speed, works for pallets/containers.
- **Ground:**  
  Trucks/vans for regional moves, final delivery, or within continents (NAFTA, EU).
- **Courier (DHL, FedEx, UPS):**  
  Door-to-door, tracking, insurance, customs clearance—higher cost for speed and reliability.

### 1.2 Incoterms: EXW, FOB, CIF, DDP, and More

- **Incoterms:**  
  Standard trade terms defining responsibility for transport, insurance, customs, and risk.
    - **EXW (Ex Works):** Buyer collects at seller’s site—buyer bears all costs/risks from factory.
    - **FOB (Free on Board):** Seller clears goods for export and loads onto ship—buyer takes over at port.
    - **CIF (Cost, Insurance, Freight):** Seller pays for shipping/insurance to destination port—buyer handles import/customs.
    - **DDP (Delivered Duty Paid):** Seller delivers to buyer’s door, pays all customs, taxes, insurance—highest seller risk/cost.
- **Choosing incoterms:**  
  Depends on your team’s experience, risk tolerance, and resources.

### 1.3 Customs, Duties, and Taxes
