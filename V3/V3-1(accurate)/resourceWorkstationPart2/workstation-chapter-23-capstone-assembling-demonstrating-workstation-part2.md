## 4. Firmware and Software Integration

### 4.1 Flashing Firmware to All Microcontrollers

- **Preparation:**
  - Ensure all hardware is assembled, power and signal lines verified.
  - Use correct programmers (ST-Link, J-Link, AVR ISP, etc.), and double-check target voltages.
  - Back up all original bootloaders and firmware.

- **Procedure:**
  - Connect programmer to relevant headers; check pinout (VCC, GND, SWD/SWDIO, RESET, etc.).
  - Power up target board; some allow USB power, others need external supply.
  - Use vendor tools (e.g., STM32CubeProgrammer, avrdude, esptool) or OpenOCD for open systems.
  - For each MCU: flash the correct .bin/.hex file, verify write (read-back/CRC), and log version.
  - For updatable systems, test in-circuit DFU/USB update methods and document process for users.

### 4.2 OS Image Preparation (Linux, RTOS, Bare Metal)

- **Embedded Linux:**
  - Build image with Yocto, Buildroot, or Armbian.
  - Customize kernel (drivers, boot options, device tree overlays) for your board.
  - Prepare rootfs: add synth app, UI binaries, audio/MIDI tools, scripts.
  - Configure auto-login, splash screen, and service startup (systemd units).
  - Flash SD, eMMC, or NAND, then test on hardware.

- **RTOS/Bare Metal:**
  - Configure linker scripts, memory maps, and startup code for your chip.
  - Integrate FreeRTOS/Zephyr/ChibiOS if applicable.
  - Build with cross-toolchain, flash, and test with serial/JTAG/USB debug.

### 4.3 Patch and Sample Management

- **Patch storage:**
  - Initialize filesystem (FAT, ext4, UBIFS) and format if needed.
  - Create default directory structure: `/patches/`, `/samples/`, `/presets/`.
  - Copy factory presets, user guides, and demo samples.
  - Test patch save, recall, and backup/restore (SysEx, USB, or cloud sync if supported).
  - Implement CRC/checksum for file integrity and handle errors gracefully.

- **Sample handling:**
  - Test loading large samples, streaming from disk, and memory mapping.
  - Profile load times and optimize cache or preload as needed.

### 4.4 Board Bring-Up: UARTs, SPI/I2C, GPIO, Audio IO

- **Serial/Debug:**  
  - Connect to each board’s UART/USB debug port. Use terminal (minicom, PuTTY, screen) to verify boot logs and command console.
  - Test loopback or echo functions to verify UART/USB operation.

- **SPI/I2C:**  
  - Use oscilloscope or logic analyzer to verify signal integrity and protocol timing.
  - Run board self-test to scan for all expected devices (codecs, EEPROM, sensors, expansion cards).
  - Log errors and missing devices for troubleshooting.

- **GPIO:**  
  - Test each digital input and output with LEDs or DMM.
  - Exercise all buttons, switches, and relays; verify state changes in firmware.

- **Audio IO:**  
  - Inject known signals (sine, square) and verify output on main jacks and headphones.
  - Use DAW or audio analyzer (RMAA, REW) for frequency response and noise floor.

### 4.5 UI/Display Bring-Up: Touch, Encoders, LEDs, Sliders

- **Display:**  
  - Verify correct power, backlight, and signal (LVDS, HDMI, SPI, I2C).
  - Test initialization sequence in code and check for stuck pixels or artifacts.
  - Run display diagnostics or color bars.

- **Touch/Encoders:**  
  - Test all touch zones, multitouch, and edge detection.
  - Rotate encoders, move sliders, press buttons; verify in logs and UI feedback.
  - Test haptic feedback motors or audio cues.

- **LEDs and Indicators:**  
  - Cycle all colors/brightness, test status and animation routines.

### 4.6 MIDI, CV, and Network Tests

- **MIDI:**  
  - Connect USB DIN MIDI controllers; send/receive notes, CC, SysEx.
  - Verify clock sync, aftertouch, and real-time messages.
  - Use MIDI-OX, MIDI Monitor, or similar tools for desktop USB testing.

- **CV/Gate:**  
  - Output voltage sweeps, measure with DMM or scope.
  - Input analog CVs, verify ADC readings and software response.
  - Test gates/triggers for proper voltage levels and timing.

- **Networking:**  
  - Test Ethernet/Wi-Fi connection, DHCP/static IP, ping, and remote SSH/web access.
  - Verify OSC, MIDI over IP, and patch sync to companion apps or servers.

### 4.7 Practice: Software Integration Test Plan

- **Create a test spreadsheet:**  
  - List all subsystems and test cases: firmware flash, boot, UI, audio IO, MIDI, patch storage, network.
  - Columns for pass/fail, notes, and tester initials.
- **Automate where possible:**  
  - Use scripts to run functional tests, log output, and compare against expected results.
- **Document all issues and resolutions.**
