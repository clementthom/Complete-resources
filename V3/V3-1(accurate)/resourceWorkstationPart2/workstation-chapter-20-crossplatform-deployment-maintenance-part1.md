## 1. Introduction to Cross-platform Deployment

### 1.1 What Is Cross-platform Deployment?

- **Definition:**  
  The process of building, packaging, and delivering your workstation firmware/software so it runs reliably on different hardware (ARM, x86), OSs (Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, RTOS, Bare Metal), and device families (embedded boards, desktops, tablets, web).
- **Goal:**  
  One codebase, many targets—minimize porting effort, maximize maintainability.

### 1.2 Why Is It Critical for Modern Workstations?

- **Your users expect seamless updates and features across devices:**  
  - Embedded workstation (main hardware)
  - Companion desktop/laptop editor/librarian
  - Mobile/tablet remote UI
  - Web-based patch browser or update manager
- **Portability = longevity:**  
  As hardware evolves, your code and features live on.
- **Community and 3rd-party support:**  
  The more platforms, the more contributors and users.

### 1.3 Typical Targets

- **Embedded Linux** (main workstation, Raspberry Pi, ARM SoCs)
- **Bare Metal** (audio engines, hybrid analog control, microcontrollers)
- **Windows/macOS/Linux** (editor, librarian, firmware update tools)
- **iOS/Android** (remote control, patch editing, performance apps)
- **Web** (patch store, online librarian, support portal)

### 1.4 Key Challenges and Opportunities

- **Challenges:**
    - Hardware differences (CPU, peripherals, endianness)
    - Real-time requirements (audio, MIDI) vs UI/networking
    - Filesystem and storage quirks
    - Different display/input paradigms
    - Security and update management across all
- **Opportunities:**
    - Share code between device, desktop, cloud
    - Build a community around open tools
    - Future-proof against hardware/OS churn

## 2. Designing for Portability from Day One

### 2.1 Abstraction Layers

- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):**  
  - Provides a uniform API for hardware access (audio, GPIO, timers, storage).
  - Platform-specific code only in the HAL; rest is portable.
- **OS Abstraction:**  
  - Unified API for threading, files, networking, timers across platforms.
- **Device Drivers:**  
  - Use vendor-provided or open drivers, but wrap them in your own interfaces.

### 2.2 Portable Code: C, C++, Rust, and Scripting

- **C/C++:**  
  - Most embedded and audio code is C/C++.
  - Stick to standard C99/C++11 (or newer), POSIX where possible.
- **Rust:**  
  - Growing in embedded and cross-platform audio; strong type safety.
- **Scripting:**  
  - Lua, Python, or JS for high-level logic or UI glue.
- **Avoid:**  
  - Compiler extensions, inline asm, or non-portable APIs—at least outside the HAL.

### 2.3 Avoiding Platform-specific Pitfalls

- **Endianness:**  
  - CPUs may be little or big endian; always use explicit byte order for file/network IO.
- **Alignment:**  
  - Some architectures require natural alignment; always use packed structs with care.
- **Word size:**  
  - `int` may be 16, 32, or 64 bits; use fixed-width types (`uint32_t`, `int16_t`).
- **File paths:**  
  - `/` on Unix, `\` on Windows; always use cross-platform path functions.
- **Threading and timers:**  
  - POSIX (pthreads), C++11 threads, or RTOS APIs; wrap in your own cross-platform layer.

### 2.4 Using Portable File and Patch Formats

- **Use:**  
  - Standard formats: WAV, AIFF, MIDI, JSON, XML, sysex
  - Your own binary format: document byte layout, version, and endianness
- **Avoid:**  
  - Proprietary, undocumented, or OS-specific formats

### 2.5 Practice: Refactoring a Platform-specific Function

**Example:**  
You have a function that uses Linux-only `inotify` to watch a file for changes:

```c
// Linux-specific
int watch_file(const char* path) {
    int fd = inotify_init();
    int wd = inotify_add_watch(fd, path, IN_MODIFY);
    // handle events...
}
```

**Portable version:**
- Abstract file watching into an interface:
    - On Linux: use `inotify`
    - On Windows: use `ReadDirectoryChangesW`
    - On macOS: use `FSEvents`
    - On RTOS: poll file mtime

```c
// Cross-platform API
typedef struct filewatcher filewatcher_t;
filewatcher_t* filewatcher_create(const char* path);
bool filewatcher_poll(filewatcher_t* fw);
void filewatcher_destroy(filewatcher_t* fw);
```

## 3. Build Systems and Continuous Integration (CI)

### 3.1 CMake, Meson, GNU Make, SCons

- **CMake:**  
  - Widely used, supports all major platforms, integrates with IDEs.
  - Generates Makefiles, Ninja, Visual Studio, Xcode, etc.
- **Meson:**  
  - Modern, Python-based, fast, good for cross-compilation.
- **GNU Make:**  
  - Flexible, simple projects, but manual dependency management.
- **SCons:**  
  - Python-based, automatic dependency tracking, good for custom builds.

### 3.2 Managing Dependencies

- **Static linking:**  
  - All libraries bundled into the binary; portable, but larger.
- **Dynamic linking:**  
  - Smaller binaries, but must ensure libraries are present on target.
- **Package managers:**  
  - `apt`, `yum`, `brew` for desktop; `conan`, `vcpkg`, `pip` for C/C++/Python.

### 3.3 CI Pipelines

- **CI services:**  
  - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Travis, Azure Pipelines.
- **Features:**  
  - Automated build/test on every commit or PR.
  - Test across target OS/architectures.
  - Build and push firmware/app artifacts.
- **Best practice:**  
  - Keep CI config in repo (`.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`).

### 3.4 Cross-compilation Toolchains

- **GCC/Clang:**  
  - `arm-none-eabi-gcc` for bare metal ARM.
  - Cross-compile for ARM, x86_64, MIPS, RISCV.
- **Sysroots and SDKs:**  
  - Use Yocto, Buildroot, OpenEmbedded for embedded Linux.
- **Emulators:**  
  - QEMU for testing ARM/x86 builds on your desktop.

### 3.5 Practice: Writing a Cross-platform CMakeLists.txt

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(workstation)

add_executable(workstation main.c synth.c ui.c)
if(WIN32)
    target_link_libraries(workstation ws2_32)
elseif(APPLE)
    target_link_libraries(workstation "-framework CoreAudio")
elseif(UNIX)
    target_link_libraries(workstation pthread m)
endif()
```

## 4. Platform Abstraction Layers and Middleware

### 4.1 Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

- **Purpose:**  
  - Isolate platform-specific code (GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART, timers, audio, display).
- **Example API:**
    ```c
    void hal_audio_start(void (*callback)(float*, int));
    void hal_gpio_set(int pin, bool state);
    void hal_display_draw(const uint8_t* buf, int x, int y, int w, int h);
    ```

### 4.2 OS Abstraction

- **POSIX layer:**  
  - For Linux/macOS/Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
- **FreeRTOS/Zephyr/CMSIS:**  
  - For RTOS/bare-metal microcontrollers.
- **RTOS abstraction:**  
  - Wrap OS calls: `hal_thread_create`, `hal_mutex_lock`, etc.

### 4.3 Middleware for Audio

- **JACK, ALSA:**  
  - Linux audio APIs; use for desktop/embedded Linux.
- **CoreAudio, ASIO, WASAPI:**  
  - macOS/Windows audio APIs; abstract behind your audio layer.
- **PortAudio, RtAudio:**  
  - Cross-platform audio I/O libraries.

### 4.4 Graphics Libraries

- **SDL2:**  
  - Simple, portable, for 2D graphics, input, audio.
- **Qt:**  
  - Rich UI, OpenGL support, cross-platform desktop/mobile.
- **LVGL, TouchGFX:**  
  - Embedded UIs for MCUs, touch screens.

### 4.5 Practice: Designing a HAL API for Audio Output

```c
// hal_audio.h
typedef void (*audio_cb_t)(float* out, int nframes);

void hal_audio_init(int samplerate, int blocksize, audio_cb_t cb);
void hal_audio_start();
void hal_audio_stop();
```

## 5. Packaging, Distribution, and Updates

### 5.1 Firmware Packaging for Embedded Devices

- **Bin/hex/srec:**  
  - Raw MCU images, flashed directly to device memory.
- **DFU (Device Firmware Update):**  
  - USB-based firmware uploads, often with fallback recovery.
- **Best practice:**  
  - Include version, CRC, and manifest with each image.

### 5.2 App Packaging

- **Desktop:**  
  - Flatpak/Snap/AppImage for Linux; MSI/EXE for Windows; DMG/PKG for macOS.
- **Mobile:**  
  - APK for Android; IPA via TestFlight or App Store for iOS.

### 5.3 Secure Updates

- **OTA (Over-the-Air):**  
  - Device downloads and installs updates from a server.
- **Offline:**  
  - User updates via USB stick, SD card, or direct computer connection.
- **Delta updates:**  
  - Only changed parts of firmware/app are sent; reduces bandwidth and risk.

### 5.4 Versioning, Rollback, and Compatibility

- **Semantic Versioning:**  
  - MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH; use for both firmware and patches.
- **Compatibility checks:**  
  - Refuse update if hardware or patch is incompatible.
- **Rollback:**  
  - Keep last working version, revert on failure.

### 5.5 Practice: Building and Flashing a Firmware Image

- **Task:**  
  - Build your firmware with CMake/Make, generate .bin/.hex.
  - Flash with `dfu-util`, `openocd`, or vendor tool.
  - Verify version on device.
