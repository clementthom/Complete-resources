## 1. Introduction to Open Source in Embedded & Hybrid Workstations

### 1.1 What Does “Open Source” Mean?

- **Open Source Software (OSS):**  
  Code that is made available under a license that allows anyone to use, study, modify, and share it.
- **Open Hardware:**  
  Schematics, PCB layouts, and design files released so others can build, modify, and distribute hardware.
- **Open Content:**  
  Samples, patches, documentation, and art shared under open licenses.

### 1.2 Why Open Source? Benefits and Tradeoffs

#### Benefits

- **Transparency:**  
  Anyone can inspect, audit, and improve the code/hardware.
- **Community:**  
  Users become contributors, testers, evangelists, and bug reporters.
- **Longevity:**  
  Projects can live on even if the company or original author moves on.
- **Innovation:**  
  “Standing on the shoulders of giants”—rapid prototyping, remixing, and extending.
- **Lower barrier to entry:**  
  Students, hobbyists, and professionals can learn and contribute.

#### Tradeoffs

- **Business models:**  
  Monetizing open source is challenging (see funding models).
- **Support burden:**  
  More users, more questions, more bug reports.
- **IP risk:**  
  Competitors can use, fork, or even sell your work (depending on license).
- **Complexity:**  
  Managing contributions, legal compliance, and community takes time.

### 1.3 Open Source Success Stories in Electronic Music

- **Mutable Instruments:**  
  Eurorack modules (hardware + firmware fully open).
- **VCV Rack:**  
  Virtual modular synth, huge plugin ecosystem.
- **PreenFM:**  
  Open hardware FM synth, many hardware and firmware forks.
- **x0xbox:**  
  DIY TB-303 clone, open hardware and software.
- **linuxsampler, ZynAddSubFX, Carla, SooperLooper:**  
  Open-source Linux audio apps.

### 1.4 The Spectrum: Hardware, Firmware, Content

- **Open Hardware:**  
  Share design files, BOM, CAD, and assembly instructions.
- **Open Firmware:**  
  Embedded code for control, DSP, UI.
- **Open Content:**  
  Sample libraries, patch banks, UI graphics, manuals.
- **Open Collaboration:**  
  Bug reports, feature requests, code/docs/patches from the community.

## 2. Understanding Software Licensing

### 2.1 What Is a Software License?

- **Definition:**  
  A legal instrument that specifies what users can and cannot do with your code.
- **Default:**  
  If you publish code with no license, others have NO right to use, modify, or distribute it!
- **License = explicit permission.**

### 2.2 Key License Families

- **Permissive:**  
  - MIT, BSD, Apache.
  - Allows nearly anything: use, modify, redistribute, commercial use, closed-sourcing.
- **Copyleft (viral):**  
  - GPL, AGPL, LGPL.
  - Derivatives must be open source under the same license.
- **Weak copyleft:**  
  - MPL, LGPL.
  - Only changes to core code must be open; can link with closed code.
- **Dual/Multi-License:**  
  - Project offers code under multiple licenses (e.g., GPL + commercial).

### 2.3 Common Licenses

#### MIT License

- **Very simple, permissive.**
- Allows use, modification, redistribution, even in closed source.
- Must include license and copyright.

#### BSD Licenses (2-Clause, 3-Clause)

- Similar to MIT, with minor differences in warranty/disclaimer clauses.

#### Apache 2.0

- Permissive, but with explicit patent grant and contributor agreements.
- Good for large projects and businesses.

#### GPL v2/v3

- Strong copyleft—any derivative or linked code must also be GPL.
- GPLv3 adds explicit patent protection and anti-TiVoization clauses.

#### LGPL

- “Library” GPL, allows linking with closed applications, but changes to the LGPL code must be open.

#### AGPL

- Like GPL, but also covers network/server use (software-as-a-service).

#### MPL (Mozilla Public License)

- File-level copyleft; only modified files must be open.

### 2.4 License Compatibility, Virality, and Linking

- **Compatibility:**  
  Not all licenses play well together. E.g., can’t link GPL with code under some other licenses.
- **Virality:**  
  GPL code “infects” derivatives, but NOT code that merely uses separate processes or IPC.
- **Linking:**  
  Static vs dynamic linking can trigger copyleft in some jurisdictions. When in doubt, ask a lawyer.

### 2.5 Choosing a License: Decision Flowchart

1. **Want maximum adoption, including in closed products?**  
   → MIT, BSD, Apache.

2. **Want every derivative to be open?**  
   → GPL, AGPL.

3. **Want to allow linking with closed code?**  
   → LGPL, MPL.

4. **Want to dual-license for business?**  
   → GPL + commercial, or consult a lawyer.

### 2.6 Practice: License Exploration and Comparison

- **Task:**  
  - Find three open-source synth projects.
  - List their licenses, and what those allow or restrict.
  - Imagine you want to use code from all three—can you? Why or why not?

## 3. Hardware Licensing and Open Hardware

### 3.1 What Is Open Hardware?

- **Open hardware means:**  
  - Schematics, PCB layouts, mechanical drawings, BOMs, firmware, and test procedures are published under an open license.
  - Others can build, modify, and sell hardware based on your design (with attribution).

### 3.2 Hardware Description Licenses

- **CERN OHL (Open Hardware License):**  
  - Strong copyleft for hardware; requires derivatives to be open.
- **TAPR Open Hardware License:**  
  - Early open hardware license, requires documentation and attribution.
- **Solderpad:**  
  - Permissive, inspired by Apache/MIT.

### 3.3 Schematics, PCB, and BOM Sharing

- **What to share:**  
  - Schematic PDFs, editable files (KiCad, Eagle, Altium), Gerbers, BOM (with part numbers), mechanical (DXF, STEP).
- **How:**  
  - GitHub, GitLab, own website, or hardware-specific repositories (e.g., Hackaday.io).
- **Best practices:**  
  - Use open formats (KiCad, SVG, STEP). Document design intent and revision history.

### 3.4 Physical Product vs. Documentation Licensing

- **Physical hardware is not copyrightable—only the design files are.**
- **You cannot restrict use, resale, or modification of hardware someone has legally built.**
- **Trademarks (product name/logo) are separate and can be protected even on open hardware.**

### 3.5 Case Study: Mutable Instruments

- **All hardware and firmware open; strong community of forks and clones.**
- **Some clones are praised, others criticized for poor quality/support.**
- **Mutable stopped production but the community continues development and support.**
- **Lesson:**  
  - Open hardware can ensure the survival and evolution of a design, but you lose some control.

### 3.6 Practice: Reviewing Open Hardware Projects

- **Task:**  
  - Find two open hardware synths or modules.
  - What files are provided? What license is used?
  - Can you build, modify, or sell your own version?

## 4. Creative Commons and Content Licensing

### 4.1 Soundware, Sample Packs, and Preset Sharing

- **Content = sound samples, patch banks, wavetables, artwork, manuals, UI graphics.**
- **Open content lets others remix, redistribute, and build upon your creative work.**

### 4.2 Creative Commons (CC) Licenses

- **CC BY:**  
  - Attribution required.
- **CC BY-SA:**  
  - Attribution + ShareAlike (derivatives must use same license).
- **CC BY-ND:**  
  - No derivatives.
- **CC BY-NC:**  
  - Non-commercial only.
- **CC0:**  
  - Public domain, no rights reserved.

### 4.3 Attribution and Community Etiquette

- **Always give credit.**
- **Link to original where possible.**
- **Respect license terms, even for “free” content.**
- **Ask before using ND or NC content in commercial or derivative projects.**

### 4.4 How to License Your Own Content

- **Include a LICENSE or README file with every sound pack, patch bank, or artwork set.**
- **State the license clearly in the file and on your website/repo.**
- **If you want maximum freedom, use CC0. If you want attribution, use CC BY.**

### 4.5 Practice: Licensing a Sample Pack or Patch Collection

- **Task:**  
  - Prepare a folder of patches or samples.
  - Add a LICENSE file with chosen CC license.
  - Write a short README with attribution and allowed uses.

## 5. Managing Mixed-Licensing in a Hybrid Workstation

### 5.1 Firmware + DSP + UI + Hardware + Content: What’s What?

- **Firmware:**  
  - Code that runs on MCUs, DSPs, or CPUs in your instrument.
- **DSP:**  
  - Audio processing algorithms; often in C, C++, or assembly.
- **UI:**  
  - Code, layouts, and artwork for screen, encoders, touch, etc.
- **Hardware:**  
  - Schematics, PCB, BOM, mechanicals.
- **Content:**  
  - Patches, samples, graphics, documentation.

### 5.2 Avoiding Licensing Conflicts

- **Check compatibility:**  
  - Don’t mix GPL and Apache code in ways that violate their terms.
- **Keep third-party code in separate folders with clear LICENSE files.**
- **Document all licenses in a top-level `LICENSES.md` or `NOTICE.md`.**
- **Ask contributors to certify they have rights to their code (see DCO/CLA).**

### 5.3 Documenting Licenses for Each Part

- **Create a license matrix:**

| Component | License | Restrictions | Third-party code? |
|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Firmware  | MIT     | Attribution  | Yes (RtAudio)     |
| DSP       | GPL     | Viral        | No                |
| UI        | Apache  | Patent grant | Yes (Qt)          |
| Hardware  | CERN OHL| Copyleft     | No                |
| Content   | CC BY   | Attribution  | Samples from user |

### 5.4 Accepting Contributions: CLAs and DCOs

- **CLA (Contributor License Agreement):**  
  - Contributor affirms they have the right to contribute and grant you a license.
- **DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin):**  
  - Contributor signs off on every commit, certifying originality and rights.

### 5.5 Practice: License Matrix for a Hybrid Workstation Project

- **Task:**  
  - Make a table of all code, hardware, and content in your project.
  - List license, source, and any restrictions for each.
  - Identify any conflicts to resolve.
