## 1. Introduction to Manufacturing and Assembly

### 1.1 What is Manufacturing and Assembly?

- **Manufacturing:**  
  The process of making your embedded workstation in quantity—turning designs into physical products using tools, machines, and people.
- **Assembly:**  
  The act of putting together all the components: PCBs, connectors, cables, displays, knobs, enclosures, and packaging.
- Both are critical to delivering a reliable, repeatable, and affordable product.

### 1.2 Why Manufacturing Matters: From Prototype to Product

- Prototyping is flexible: you hand-solder, tweak, fix, and bodge.
- Production must be reliable, repeatable, and cost-effective at any scale (10, 100, 10,000 units).
- **Problems solved in manufacturing:**
    - Reducing cost per unit (economies of scale)
    - Ensuring every unit works and looks the same
    - Meeting safety and regulatory requirements
    - Enabling service, upgrades, and future revisions

### 1.3 The Beginner’s Mindset: Communication, Documentation, and Quality

- **Communication:**  
  Clear specs, drawings, and expectations prevent costly mistakes.
- **Documentation:**  
  Every part, step, and change must be recorded for the factory and for troubleshooting.
- **Quality:**  
  Build in quality at every step—not just at the end.
- **Patience and learning:**  
  Every production run reveals new lessons.

### 1.4 Overview: Stages of Production

1. Design and prototype
2. Pre-production (pilot run)
3. Mass production
4. Testing and QA
5. Shipping, field support, and warranty

## 2. Supply Chain Management

### 2.1 What is a Supply Chain?

- The entire network of vendors, factories, shippers, warehouses, and partners that provide every part and sub-assembly in your product.
- **Links in the chain:**  
  - Raw materials (plastic, metal, silicon)
  - Components (ICs, passives, connectors, displays)
  - Sub-assemblies (PCBs, cables, keybeds)
  - Final assembly and packaging
  - Logistics (shipping, customs, warehousing)

### 2.2 Key Elements: Components, Vendors, Logistics, Lead Times

- **Components:**  
  - Each item on your BOM, from resistors to displays.
- **Vendors:**  
  - Suppliers for each item—may be local, regional, or global.
- **Logistics:**  
  - How parts get from suppliers to your factory—shipping modes, customs.
- **Lead time:**  
  - Time from ordering to arrival at your facility. Can be days (passives) to months (custom chips, displays).

### 2.3 BOM (Bill of Materials) Management

- **BOM:**  
  A master spreadsheet or database listing every part, quantity, supplier, part number, and (ideally) alternates.
- **Version control:**  
  Track changes—every revision of your design should have its own BOM version.
- **BOM health:**  
  Check for EOL, NRND (Not Recommended for New Design), or obsolete parts regularly.

### 2.4 Sourcing Strategies: Single vs. Multiple Vendors

- **Single-source:**  
  Lower negotiation power, higher risk if vendor fails.
- **Multi-source:**  
  Reduces risk, gives price leverage, but adds complexity.
- **Global vs. local:**  
  Local can be faster and easier for small runs; global is often cheaper for scale.

### 2.5 Negotiating with Suppliers

- **Key factors:**  
  Price, lead time, payment terms, minimum order quantity (MOQ), quality, and after-sales service.
- **Negotiation tips:**  
  - Build a relationship—visit if possible.
  - Be honest about volumes and needs.
  - Get everything in writing: specs, prices, delivery dates, penalties for late delivery.
  - Don’t squeeze too hard—quality and service may suffer.

### 2.6 Risk Management: Shortages, Obsolescence, and Alternatives

- **Shortages:**  
  - Have backup plans for critical parts; pre-order for long lead items.
- **Obsolescence:**  
  - Watch for EOL notices, keep in touch with suppliers.
- **Alternatives:**  
  - List approved alternates in the BOM, pre-test them.

### 2.7 Practice: Building a Supply Chain Map for a Workstation Project

- List all key components and vendors.
- Draw a flowchart: supplier → shipping → warehouse/factory → assembly → final test → shipping to customer.
- Identify weakest links and develop contingency plans.
