## 1. Introduction and Capstone Philosophy

### 1.1 Why a Capstone Project?

- **Synthesis of All Skills:**  
  This capstone brings together hardware, firmware, software, user experience, testing, and documentation—mirroring a real-world engineering project.
- **Portfolio-Ready:**  
  A completed workstation is a showcase for employers, collaborators, or the open-source community.
- **Hands-On Mastery:**  
  Assembling, debugging, and demonstrating your own system cements knowledge far more than reading or simulation.

### 1.2 Learning Objectives and Skills Demonstrated

- **System-level thinking:** Integration of analog, digital, UI, storage, and networking.
- **Hardware assembly:** Board population, soldering, connectorization, cable management.
- **Firmware bring-up:** Microcontroller programming, bootloader, device tree, and driver debugging.
- **Software and OS integration:** File systems, audio engines, patch management, UI, and networking.
- **Testing and QA:** Functional, regression, and performance testing, plus documentation and demo prep.

### 1.3 What Does Success Look Like?

- **A working, stable, and documented workstation** that:
    - Boots reliably and quickly.
    - Produces audio with multiple engines (analog, digital, hybrid).
    - Responds to user input (UI, MIDI, network).
    - Loads/saves patches and samples.
    - Passes functional and QA tests.
    - Is ready for demo, recording, or live show.

### 1.4 Project Documentation Checklist

- [ ] Block diagrams and circuit schematics
- [ ] BOM with part numbers, suppliers, and cost
- [ ] Firmware/software source code and build scripts
- [ ] Calibration and assembly procedures
- [ ] User manual, quickstart, and troubleshooting guide

  - Separate repos or subfolders for hardware, firmware, software, docs, and content.
- **Suggested structure:**
    ```
    workstation/
      |- hardware/
      |    |- analog_board/
      |    |- digital_board/
      |    |- power/
      |- firmware/
      |- software/
      |- docs/
      |- patches/
      |- samples/
      |- tests/
      |- scripts/
    ```
- **Tag releases** for hardware revisions, firmware versions, and major milestones.

### 2.5 Safety, ESD, and Workspace Setup

- **ESD protection:**  
  - Wrist strap, anti-static mat, grounded iron.
- **Ventilation:**  
  - Solder fumes, cleaning solvents.
- **Safe tool use:**  
  - Proper soldering, desoldering, crimping, and hot air rework.
- **Label everything:**  
  - Bags, reels, boards, cables—avoid confusion during assembly!
- **Workspace:**  
  - Clean, well-lit, organized bench with storage for tools and parts.

### 2.6 Practice: Assembling a Comprehensive Build Plan

- **Create a spreadsheet or project board**
    - List each subsystem (voice card, CPU, UI, storage, power, etc.)
    - Columns: status (design, ordered, received, assembled, tested), notes, dependencies
- **Draw a block diagram** (digital or paper) showing all boards, interconnects, and power rails
- **Draft a Gantt chart** (timeline) for major build steps

  - Chassis ground at power entry; avoid ground loops
- **Cooling:**  
  - Fans, vents, heat pipes as needed; dust filters if required

### 3.8 Practice: Hardware Assembly Checklist

- [ ] All PCBs inspected, cleaned, and tested for shorts
- [ ] All connectors labeled and strain relieved
