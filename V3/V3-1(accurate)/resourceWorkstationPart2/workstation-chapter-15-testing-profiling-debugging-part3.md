## 1. Fault Injection and Robustness Testing

### 1.1 What is Fault Injection? Why is it Important?

- **Fault injection** is the deliberate introduction of errors/faults into a system to test how well it handles unexpected conditions.
- **Purpose:**  
  - To ensure your workstation doesn’t crash, lock up, or misbehave when something goes wrong (hardware or software).
- **Types:**  
  - Hardware faults (e.g., unplugging cables, forced power brownout).
  - Software faults (e.g., bad data, simulated resource exhaustion).
- **Why:**  
  - Real-world systems always encounter faults. Testing for them makes your device robust and trustworthy.

### 1.2 Manual and Automated Fault Injection: Methods and Tools

- **Manual:**  
  - Physically unplug/replug cables, remove SD cards, short pins, power cycle.
  - Manually inject invalid MIDI or corrupted audio files.
- **Automated:**  
  - Use relay boards, programmable power supplies, fault injection hardware.
  - Software: inject faults via debug hooks, scripts, or test frameworks.
- **Recording results:**  
  - Always log system behavior after fault: did it recover, crash, or hang?

### 1.3 Simulating Hardware Failures: Power, IO, Peripheral Faults

- **Power:**  
  - Brown-out (lower voltage), sudden loss, rapid cycling.
  - Use programmable supply or relay.
- **IO/Peripheral:**  
  - Disconnect/reconnect USB, MIDI, audio, network.
  - Simulate stuck/faulty buttons, analog noise, shorted lines.
- **Sensors:**  
  - Inject out-of-range or noisy sensor values.

### 1.4 Software Fault Injection: Exceptions, Corrupt Data, Race Conditions

- **Exceptions:**  
  - Force divide-by-zero, null pointer dereference, or invalid memory access in code.
- **Corrupt data:**  
  - Modify memory, simulate bad packets, truncated files.
- **Race conditions:**  
  - Use scripts or test harnesses to trigger thread contention or missed synchronization.

### 1.5 Practice: Injecting and Detecting Faults in an Audio Engine

- Write a test that feeds random/corrupted MIDI events to the audio callback.
- Simulate buffer underrun and observe recovery (or crash).
- Force unexpected thread preemption and log any audio glitches or errors.

## 2. Stress Testing and Soak Testing in Embedded Workstations

### 2.1 Stress Testing: Pushing the Limits (CPU, Memory, IO, Audio/MIDI Throughput)

- **CPU/memory:**  
  - Run max polyphony, enable all FX, fill RAM, max out DSP load.
- **IO:**  
  - Trigger rapid file loads/saves, MIDI floods, fast UI/automation.
- **Network:**  
  - Blast with RTP-MIDI, OSC, or audio-over-IP packets.
- **Goal:**  
  - Find weak points, race conditions, timing failures before users do.

### 2.2 Soak Testing: Long-Duration, Real-World Scenarios

- **Soak test:**  
  - Run the system for hours/days under realistic, or extreme, use.
- **Purpose:**  
  - Find resource leaks (memory, file handles), thermal issues, slow degradation.
- **Instrumentation:**  
  - Log CPU, memory, temperature, error counts, and performance metrics.
- **Power cycling:**  
  - Include scheduled or random reboots to test persistence and recovery.

### 2.3 Automating Stress and Soak: Scripting and Monitoring

- **Scripting:**  
  - Use Python or Bash to trigger events, press buttons, send MIDI, load patches.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Collect logs, screenshots, audio/MIDI output, and health stats.
- **Alerting:**  
  - Set up email/SMS/Slack notifications on failure or threshold exceeded.

### 2.4 Data Collection: Memory Leaks, Resource Exhaustion, Thermal Issues

- **Memory:**  
  - Periodically sample heap/stack usage, detect leaks/growth.
- **Resource exhaustion:**  
  - Open/close files, connections rapidly; check for errors.
- **Thermal:**  
  - Use temp sensors; log and plot over time for overheating.

### 2.5 Practice: Setting Up a 24h Soak Test with Automated Logging and Alerts

- Script to power cycle device every hour.
- Load and play random patches/sequences.
- Monitor and log CPU, memory, error count, and temperature.
- Alert on any crash, reboot, or error spike.

## 3. Advanced Debugging: Concurrency, Real-Time, and Heisenbugs

### 3.1 Debugging Concurrency: Locks, Deadlocks, Race Conditions

- **Concurrency bugs:**  
  - Happen when multiple threads/tasks access shared data incorrectly.
- **Locks:**  
  - Used to protect data; can cause deadlock if not used carefully.
- **Deadlock:**  
  - Two tasks wait forever for each other to release a resource.
- **Race condition:**  
  - Timing-dependent bug where the result depends on which task “wins” access.
- **Detection:**  
  - Use static analysis, thread sanitizer, and stress tests to reveal.

### 3.2 Real-Time Constraints: Missed Deadlines, Priority Inversions

- **Missed deadline:**  
  - Audio or MIDI callback takes too long, causing glitch/dropout.
- **Priority inversion:**  
  - High-priority task blocked by a lower-priority one holding a shared resource.
- **Detection:**  
  - Log callback times, use real-time OS tools to monitor scheduling.

### 3.3 Heisenbugs: Elusive, Non-Repeatable Bugs

- **Heisenbug:**  
  - Bug that disappears or changes behavior when you try to observe it (e.g., with debugger or print statements).
- **Causes:**  
  - Uninitialized memory, timing, hardware state, concurrency.
- **Strategies:**  
  - Use minimal logging, hardware trace, or record/replay tools.

### 3.4 Advanced Breakpoints and Watchpoints: Conditional, Data, Hardware

- **Conditional breakpoints:**  
  - Only trigger when a variable has a certain value.
- **Data watchpoints:**  
  - Pause when a variable or memory location changes.
- **Hardware breakpoints:**  
  - Set in MCU hardware; don’t slow down code like software breakpoints.
- **Use cases:**  
  - Catch rare or timing-sensitive bugs without affecting timing.

### 3.5 Practice: Debugging a Real-Time MIDI Scheduler with Race Conditions

- Simulate two threads updating the same MIDI buffer.
- Use thread sanitizer or static analysis to detect races.
- Add locks or atomic variables; verify problem is solved.

## 4. Fuzzing and Randomized Testing for Embedded Systems

### 4.1 What is Fuzzing? Types and Why It Works

- **Fuzzing:**  
  - Automated testing technique that feeds random, invalid, or unexpected data to your system.
- **Types:**  
  - Black box (random input), white box (guided by code structure), protocol-aware.
- **Why:**  
  - Finds bugs and vulnerabilities you would never think to test by hand.

### 4.2 MIDI/OSC/Control Input Fuzzing: Protocol Robustness

- **MIDI fuzzing:**  
  - Send random bytes, malformed SysEx, rapid note on/off, illegal values.
- **OSC fuzzing:**  
  - Random addresses, types, payloads.
- **Goal:**  
  - Find crashes, hangs, or misbehavior in protocol parsers.

### 4.3 Audio Buffer and File Format Fuzzing

- **Audio buffer:**  
  - Pass in too-short, too-long, or corrupted buffers.
- **File format:**  
  - Feed random or malformed WAV, AIFF, or patch files into the loader.
- **Check:**  
  - System should reject gracefully, not crash.

### 4.4 Automated Fuzzer Setup: Tools and Harnesses

- **AFL (American Fuzzy Lop):**  
  - Popular open-source fuzzer; can work with instrumented binaries.
- **libFuzzer:**  
  - In-process, coverage-guided fuzzer for C/C++.
- **Custom scripts:**  
  - Python or C to generate random MIDI/audio/OSC data.
- **Integration:**  
  - Add fuzz targets to CI for regular, automated robustness testing.

### 4.5 Practice: Building a Simple Fuzzer for MIDI Input

- Write a script/program that sends random MIDI bytes at high speed.
- Monitor device for crashes or stuck states.
- Log and reduce input to find minimal “bad” input that triggers bugs.

## 5. Post-Mortem Analysis and Crash Dump Handling

### 5.1 Capturing Crashes: Stack Traces, Core Dumps, Minidumps

- **Stack trace:**  
  - List of function calls leading up to a crash.
- **Core dump:**  
  - Snapshot of program memory and registers at the moment of crash.
- **Minidump:**  
  - Smaller version, just key data.
- **How to collect:**  
  - Enable crash handlers in firmware; dump to flash, SD, or over serial/network.

### 5.2 Embedded Crash Handlers: Watchdog, Panic Handlers, Log Ring Buffers

- **Watchdog:**  
  - Hardware timer that reboots device if main loop stalls.
- **Panic handler:**  
  - Special code that runs on crash; dumps logs, blinks LED, or saves state.
- **Ring buffer logging:**  
  - Keep recent logs in a circular buffer in RAM.

### 5.3 Analyzing Dumps: Symbol Files, Address Decoding, Call Stack Reconstruction

- **Symbols:**  
  - Use .elf/.map files to translate program addresses to function/line numbers.
- **Address decoding:**  
  - Tools (addr2line, GDB) to map crash addresses to source.
- **Call stack:**  
  - Reconstruct stack to see the chain of calls; helps pinpoint the bug.

### 5.4 Field Fault Reporting: Auto-Upload, Privacy, and Security

- **Auto-upload:**  
  - Device sends crash logs to cloud/server.
- **Privacy:**  
  - Strip sensitive data; encrypt logs if needed.
- **Security:**  
  - Signed logs to prevent tampering.

### 5.5 Practice: Setting Up and Analyzing a Crash Dump Pipeline

- Enable crash handler in firmware.
- On crash, save minidump to SD or flash.
- Write script to extract, decode, and upload crash logs.
- Analyze logs to find root cause.

## 6. Self-Healing and Robust System Design

### 6.1 Watchdogs, Heartbeats, and Automatic Recovery

- **Watchdog timer:**  
  - Main loop “kicks” the watchdog; if not kicked, MCU resets.
- **Heartbeats:**  
  - Regular “I’m alive” messages between threads/tasks or devices.
- **Automatic recovery:**  
  - On error, reset subsystem, reload patch, or reboot device.

### 6.2 Resource Leaks and Automatic Cleanup

- **Resource leaks:**  
  - Memory, file handles, MIDI/audio buffers not released.
- **Automatic cleanup:**  
  - On error or shutdown, ensure all resources are freed.

### 6.3 Graceful Degradation: Fallback Paths and Safe Mode

- **Fallback:**  
  - If one feature fails, system keeps running with reduced functionality.
  - Example: Disable advanced FX if DSP overloads.
- **Safe mode:**  
  - Boot minimal UI/audio only for recovery.

### 6.4 Redundancy and State Replication

- **Redundancy:**  
  - Duplicate hardware or software modules; failover on error.
- **State replication:**  
  - Keep copy of critical state for fast recovery after crash.

### 6.5 Practice: Implementing a Watchdog and Recovery Routine

- Set up watchdog timer in firmware.
- Write auto-recovery handler for audio or UI crash.
- Simulate crash and ensure the system recovers without user intervention.
