## 1. Multi-Board and Modular System Design

### 1.1 Why Use Multiple Boards? Pros and Cons

- **Pros:**
  - Easier to fit large or oddly-shaped enclosures.
  - Can separate noisy (digital) and sensitive (analog) circuits physically.
  - Makes upgrades and repairs simpler (swap a board, not the whole device).
  - Parallel development: teams can work on boards independently.
- **Cons:**
  - Adds cost (extra connectors, cables, assembly time).
  - More mechanical complexity (alignment, mounting).
  - Signal integrity risk on board-to-board connections (longer traces, connectors).

### 1.2 Board Interconnects: Ribbon, FFC, Board-to-Board, and Backplanes

- **Ribbon cables:**  
  - Flat, flexible, good for lots of signals. Use keyed connectors to avoid reversal.
- **FFC (Flexible Flat Cable):**  
  - Ultra-thin, used for LCDs, front panels. Careful with insertion/removal; use ZIF connectors.
- **Board-to-board connectors:**  
  - Pin headers, sockets, edge connectors; can be vertical or right-angle.
- **Backplanes:**  
  - One large board with slots for daughterboards; used in modular synths, rack systems.

### 1.3 Power and Signal Distribution Across Boards

- Use separate power and ground lines for each board.
- Decouple each board with local capacitors and ferrites.
- For high-current, use thick traces, busbars, or dedicated power connectors.
- Route clocks, resets, and sensitive signals away from noisy power or digital lines.

### 1.4 Addressing, Identification, and Hot-Swap

- Use jumpers, DIP switches, or I2C addresses to identify boards.
- For hot-swap (replace while powered):  
  - Use connectors with staggered pins (grounds connect first/last).
  - Add ESD and inrush protection.
  - Detect and initialize new boards via firmware.

### 1.5 System-Level Grounding and Shielding

- Star ground or single-point connection between boards.
- Tie shields to chassis at one point to avoid ground loops.
- Use shielded cables for external runs (audio, MIDI, USB).

### 1.6 Practice: Designing a Two-Board Workstation (Main+Front Panel)

- Separate MCU/processor and power on main board.
- Place buttons, encoders, displays, and LEDs on front panel board.
- Use FFC or ribbon for interconnect. Map out signals and power, add decoupling.

## 2. High-Speed Digital and Mixed-Signal Design

### 2.1 What is High-Speed? USB, Ethernet, DDR, TFT, Audio Clocks

- **High-speed signals:**  
  - USB (>12Mbps), Ethernet (100Mbps or faster), DDR RAM, LVDS displays, digital audio clocks (>1MHz).
- **Why special handling?**
  - At high frequencies, signal traces behave like transmission lines, not wires.
  - Reflections, ringing, and timing errors can cause data loss, distortion.

### 2.2 Controlled Impedance and Differential Pairs

- **Controlled impedance:**  
  - PCB stackup and trace width/spacing set impedance, usually 50Ω (single-ended) or 100Ω (differential pair).
- **Differential pairs:**  
  - Matched-length, equal-width traces carrying opposite signals (e.g., USB D+/D-, Ethernet pairs).
  - Reduce noise, cancel interference, increase data rate.

### 2.3 Signal Integrity: Reflections, Crosstalk, Skew, and Termination

- **Reflections:**  
  - Occur at impedance mismatches; fix with proper terminations and matching.
- **Crosstalk:**  
  - Interference from nearby traces; fix with spacing, ground planes.
- **Skew:**  
  - When one trace in a pair is longer, signals arrive at different times; match lengths closely.
- **Termination:**  
  - Resistors at ends of transmission lines prevent reflections.

### 2.4 Clock Distribution and Jitter Minimization

- **Clock trees:**  
  - Distribute clocks with matched-length, low-skew traces.
- **Jitter:**  
  - Fast random changes in clock timing; causes sync loss, audio clicks. Use low-jitter oscillators and buffers.
- **Crystal vs. MEMS:**  
  - Crystals give lower jitter; MEMS are smaller, more robust but higher jitter.

### 2.5 Layout for Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Signals

- **Synchronous:**  
  - All signals referenced to the same clock; easier to route, less risk of setup/hold violations.
- **Asynchronous:**  
  - No shared clock; must use synchronizers or FIFO buffers at crossings.

### 2.6 Simulation and Validation Tools

- Use signal integrity (SI) simulators (e.g., HyperLynx, SiSoft) to model high-speed traces.
- Validate with oscilloscope, TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry), or network analyzer.

### 2.7 Practice: Laying Out a USB and Audio Clock Section

- Use differential pairs for USB D+/D-; match length, keep close.
- Route audio master clock away from switching supplies and digital traces.
- Add termination resistors and decoupling caps.

## 3. Advanced Analog Design for Audio and Sensing

### 3.1 Op-Amp Selection, Layout, and Power Supply Decoupling

- **Op-amp selection:**  
  - Look for low noise, low offset, high slew rate for audio.
- **Layout:**  
  - Short, direct feedback and input traces.
  - Keep away from digital clocks and power supplies.
- **Decoupling:**  
  - Place 0.1μF and 10μF caps near each op-amp power pin.

### 3.2 Noise Sources: Power, Ground, EMI, and Component Selection

- **Power:**  
  - Switching noise, ripple, and spikes; use LDOs for analog rails.
- **Ground:**  
  - Shared ground with digital can inject noise; use star ground or split planes.
- **EMI:**  
  - Long traces/cables, nearby digital circuits.
- **Component choice:**  
  - Use metal film resistors for low noise, quality film caps for audio.

### 3.3 Ground Loops and Hum: Prevention and Debugging

- **Ground loops:**  
  - Multiple return paths through ground; cause hum and buzz.
- **Prevention:**  
  - Single-point ground, isolate audio ground from chassis.
- **Debugging:**  
  - Lift grounds, use oscilloscope to trace hum source.

### 3.4 Analog Filtering: Anti-Aliasing, Reconstruction, and EMI Filters

- **Anti-aliasing:**  
  - Low-pass filter before ADC to block signals above Nyquist frequency.
- **Reconstruction:**  
  - Low-pass after DAC to smooth staircase waveform.
- **EMI filter:**  
  - Small cap and resistor/ferrite on input lines to block RF.

### 3.5 Shielding Strategies for Sensitive Analog Paths

- **Board-level:**  
  - Ground pour/shield under analog traces, guard rings around inputs.
- **Cable-level:**  
  - Use shielded cables, ground shield at one end only (to avoid loops).
- **Enclosure-level:**  
  - Metal cans/cases, separate analog/digital compartments.

### 3.6 Practice: Designing a Low-Noise Audio Input/Output Section

- Select low-noise op-amp, metal film resistors.
- Star ground input/output, shielded cable from jack to board.
- Add anti-aliasing filter before ADC and reconstruction filter after DAC.
