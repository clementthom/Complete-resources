## 4. Artificial Intelligence in Hybrid Workstations

### 4.1 AI for Sound Design

- **Neural Synths:**  
  - Use deep neural networks (DNNs) to model, generate, or morph timbres and waveforms.
  - Examples: NSynth (Google Magenta), RAVE (Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder).
  - Potential: Data-driven sound design, new timbres, “interpolate” between existing patches.

- **Style Transfer:**  
  - Apply “characteristics” of one sound or instrument to another (like audio “filters” for style).
  - Example: Transfer a cello’s expressive dynamics to a synth patch.

- **Generative Synthesis:**  
  - Use AI to create entirely new sounds, patches, or even synthesis algorithms from data.
  - Can learn from user-favorites, trending genres, or unique combinations.

### 4.2 AI-Assisted Sequencing, Chord and Melody Generation

- **AI-powered sequencers:**  
  - Generate or suggest drum patterns, basslines, or melodies based on style, mood, or user input.
  - Examples: AIVA, Google Magenta, Ableton “Note/Scale/Chord” suggestions.

- **Adaptive accompaniment:**  
  - AI listens to your playing (tempo, key, style) and generates harmonies, counterpoint, or arrangements in real time.

- **Human-AI collaboration:**  
  - User can “nudge” the AI to evolve a sequence, randomize, or lock favorite parts.

### 4.3 Smart Patch Browsers, Tagging, and Recommendation Engines

- **Automatic tagging:**  
  - Use machine learning to analyze and tag patches by timbre, genre, or emotion (“warm pad,” “bright lead”).
  - Accelerate browsing, especially with thousands of patches.

- **Recommendation engines:**  
  - Suggest patches similar to what you’re using, or ones trending in the community.
  - Personalized search: “Find me a lush string pad for synthwave.”

- **Voice assistants:**  
  - Natural language search: “Show me mellow piano sounds.”

### 4.4 Real-Time Audio Analysis

- **Onset/beat detection:**  
  - AI models detect note onsets, rhythm, and tempo for live synchronization or looping.
- **Key and scale detection:**  
  - Automatically analyze the key of a performance or sample.
- **Genre and timbre classification:**  
  - Suggest patch or effect changes based on detected genre or timbre.
- **Dynamic adaptation:**  
  - Automatically adjust effects, mix, or patch based on live audio input.

### 4.5 Interactive Learning and Adaptive Interfaces

- **Guided learning:**  
  - Built-in tutorials adapt based on user progress and errors.
- **Performance feedback:**  
  - AI “coach” gives feedback on timing, accuracy, and musicality.

### 4.6 Practice: Integrating a Simple AI Model for Patch Recommendations

- **Tools:** TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile for embedded inference.
- **Data:**  
  - Collect patch usage statistics, user favorites, ratings.
- **Model:**  
  - Simple k-nearest neighbors (KNN) or neural net trained on patch features and usage.
- **Integration:**  
  - When user browses patches, recommend similar or popular patches using the trained model.
- **UI:**  
  - “You might also like...”, “Trending,” or “Similar to current patch.”
