## 1. Introduction to Optimization for Embedded Systems

### 1.1 What Is Embedded Optimization?

- **Optimization** in embedded systems means making the best use of limited resources: CPU, RAM, storage, bandwidth, power, and time.
- Your workstation must **boot quickly**, **run reliably**, and **deliver low-latency audio**—even on modest hardware.

### 1.2 Why Optimization Matters in Workstations

- **Musicians expect instant response:**  
  Any glitch, delay, or UI lag ruins the experience.
- **Embedded hardware is often limited:**  
  Less RAM, slower CPU, and smaller storage than desktop systems.
- **Reliability:**  
  A crash on stage is unacceptable, so every cycle and byte counts.

### 1.3 Key Differences: Embedded Linux vs Bare Metal

- **Embedded Linux:**
    - Full OS, multitasking, drivers, filesystems, networking, user space/kernel space.
    - Good for complex UI, file IO, networking, third-party apps.
- **Bare Metal:**
    - No OS; you write the main loop and handle peripherals directly.
    - Maximum control and speed, but more work for everything.
- **RTOS:**
    - Lightweight kernel, deterministic scheduling, real-time features.
    - Good compromise for timing-critical tasks (audio, MIDI).

### 1.4 Overview of Typical Hardware Platforms

- **ARM Cortex-A (Linux):**  
  Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, i.MX, STM32MP1 — good for UI, networking, complex apps.
- **ARM Cortex-M (Bare Metal/RTOS):**  
  STM32, NXP, TI — great for audio engines, control, and low-latency IO.
- **DSPs:**  
  SHARC, Blackfin, C6000 — used for effects, mixing, synthesis.
- **x86 (Linux):**  
  Mini-PCs, NUCs, industrial boards — most power, least efficient.
- **MCUs:**  
  Atmel, Microchip, Espressif — for control, sensors, housekeeping.

## 2. Choosing Your Platform: Linux, RTOS, or Bare Metal?

### 2.1 Embedded Linux: Pros, Cons, and Typical Use Cases

- **Pros:**
    - Rich drivers, networking, USB, large storage, modern UI.
    - Easier to port code (Linux audio APIs, Qt, SDL, etc.).
    - Multi-user, process isolation, third-party support.
- **Cons:**
    - Higher boot time, larger resource footprint.
    - Harder to achieve hard real-time for audio/MIDI.
    - Kernel/user space bugs and security complexity.

- **Use Cases:**
    - Main workstation UI
    - File management, patch/sample browser
    - Networking, remote control

### 2.2 Bare Metal: Pros, Cons, and Typical Use Cases

- **Pros:**
    - Ultimate real-time performance, lowest latency.
    - Minimum overhead, instant boot.
    - Full control of every cycle and interrupt.
- **Cons:**
    - No OS features: manual driver, file, and protocol handling.
    - Harder to debug, limited libraries.
    - No process isolation; a crash kills everything.

- **Use Cases:**
    - Audio engine (synth voice, FX, mixer)
    - Tight MIDI IO, clock, sync
    - Safety-critical control (power, sensors)

### 2.3 Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS): Where They Fit

- **RTOS examples:** FreeRTOS, Zephyr, ChibiOS, RTX, NuttX
- **Features:** Preemptive, priority-based scheduling, deterministic timing, some filesystem/networking.
- **Use Cases:**  
    - Hybrid audio engines
    - Multi-core audio/MIDI scheduling
    - Bridging between Linux and bare metal engines

### 2.4 Decision Matrix

| Subsystem        | Linux | RTOS | Bare Metal | Notes                              |
|------------------|-------|------|------------|------------------------------------|
| Main UI          |  X    |      |            | Qt/SDL/Touchscreen                 |
| PCM Engine       |       |  X   |   X        | Real-time audio, low latency       |
| MIDI I/O         |       |  X   |   X        | Timing critical                    |
| Patch Storage    |  X    |  X   |            | Large files, FAT/Ext4              |

| Effects DSP      |       |  X   |   X        | Fast FIR/IIR processing            |
| Networking       |  X    |      |            | OSC, Web UI, Remote                |

### 2.5 Practice: Platform Selection Exercise

- **Scenario:** You want fast boot, low-latency audio, flexible UI, and remote control.
    - Which subsystems would you run on Linux, which on bare metal, which on RTOS?
    - Draw a block diagram showing which tasks go where.

## 3. Boot and Startup Optimization

### 3.1 Anatomy of Embedded Boot Process

- **Bootloader:**  
  (u-boot, Barebox, custom) Starts CPU, loads kernel or app from flash/SD.
- **Kernel:**  
  (Linux or RTOS) Initializes drivers, devices, mounts filesystems.
- **Init:**  
  (systemd, busybox, rc scripts) Starts user-space processes.
- **User App:**  
  Your synth engine, UI, sequencer, etc.

### 3.2 Reducing Boot Time

- **Tips for Linux:**
    - Disable unused kernel drivers, modules, and services.
    - Use a minimal init system (BusyBox, custom script).
    - Optimize filesystem layout (put UI, audio, and settings on fast storage).
    - Preload or cache critical files, fonts, and samples.
    - Show splash screen as soon as framebuffer is ready.
    - Delay non-critical services (network, update checks) until after UI/audio ready.

- **Tips for Bare Metal:**
    - Use direct jump to main() after hardware init.
    - Pre-initialize audio and MIDI before UI.

### 3.3 Fast Boot for Performance Instruments

- **Target:** <2-3 seconds from power-on to audio ready.
- **Best practices:**
    - Keep root filesystem in RAM (initramfs) for ultra-fast boot.
    - Use static linking for your synth app.
    - Optimize splash/boot logo for instant feedback.

### 3.4 Boot Scripts, Services, and Dependency Management

- **Profile critical path:**  
  Use `systemd-analyze` or `bootchart` to measure startup.
- **Disable:**  
  Any service not needed for the main instrument function (e.g., cron, ssh, unused daemons).
- **Parallelize:**  
  Start audio engine and UI together if possible, delay network or USB.

### 3.5 Practice: Measuring and Profiling Boot Time

- **Task:** Time your device from power-on to first audio output.
- **Tools:** `systemd-analyze`, serial debug prints, stopwatch.
- **Improve:** Comment out services, measure again.

## 4. CPU and Memory Optimization

### 4.1 Understanding CPU Load

- **Real-time audio runs at high priority:**  
  Needs guaranteed CPU time.
- **UI and background tasks run at lower priority.**
- **CPU affinity:**  
  Pin critical threads to a dedicated core if possible (SMP systems).

### 4.2 Measuring and Profiling CPU Usage

- **Tools:**  
  - `top`, `htop` for live stats.
  - `ps` for per-process stats.
  - `perf`, `oprofile`, `gprof` for code profiling.
- **Look for:**  
  - Audio thread %CPU.
  - Interrupt handler load.
  - UI vs audio contention.

### 4.3 Memory Footprint

- **Static allocation:**  
  For real-time data, avoid malloc/free in audio thread.
- **Heap usage:**  
  Profile with `mallinfo`, `valgrind`, or RTOS stats.
- **Stack monitoring:**  
  Use canaries or RTOS tools to check for overflow.

### 4.4 Reducing RAM Usage

- **Use fixed-size pools for audio buffers.**
- **Sparse data structures for patch/sample maps.**
- **Memory-mapped files (mmap) for large samples.**
- **Release UI and graphics resources when not visible.**

### 4.5 Cache, DMA, and Memory Alignment

- **Cache:**  
  Use CPU cache for tight loops, avoid cache thrashing.
- **DMA:**  
  Use for audio IO, sample transfer, and offloading CPU.
- **Alignment:**  
  Align buffers to 32/64 bytes for DMA and cache efficiency.

### 4.6 Practice: Analyzing CPU and RAM Usage in a Synth App

- **Profile:** Run your synth app under `htop` and `valgrind` (or RTOS stats).
- **Identify:** Which tasks use the most CPU and RAM?
- **Optimize:** Move heavy tasks to lower priority/background.
