## 1. Modern Workstation Teardowns: Step-by-Step

### 1.1 Why Teardown? What to Look For

- **Purpose:**  
  - Understand construction, layout, modularity, and repairability.
  - Discover how classic lessons are applied (or not) today.
  - Identify cost-saving, service, or design tradeoffs.
- **Look for:**  
  - Board types (main, UI, power, audio, expansion)
  - Connectors, cabling, shielding
  - Cooling, mechanical mounting, chassis design
  - Service features: test points, labeled connectors, firmware update ports

### 1.2 Tools and Safety for Beginners

- **Basic tools:**  
  Screwdrivers (JIS, Philips, Torx), spudger, ESD strap, plastic pry tools, camera.
- **Safety:**  
  Unplug power, avoid static discharge, take photos at each step.
- **Label screws and cables:**  
  Use tape or bags for small parts.
- **Document everything:**  
  Photos, notes, and diagrams.

### 1.3 Example: Korg Kronos Teardown

- **Chassis:**  
  Metal base, plastic or aluminum end caps, removable bottom panel.
- **Boards:**  
  - Main CPU (often an off-the-shelf PC motherboard)
  - Audio IO (custom)
  - UI/Touchscreen controller
  - Power supply (internal, often switching, with EMI filtering)
- **Cabling:**  
  Flat flex for display, shielded audio, ribbon for UI.
- **Service features:**  
  SSD drive accessible for upgrades, labeled connectors.
- **Observations:**  
  Modular, but tight fit; some service steps require full disassembly.

### 1.4 Example: Roland Fantom Teardown

- **Chassis:**  
  Metal case, internal structural supports, modular keybed.
- **Boards:**  
  - Main board (SoC, memory, flash)
  - UI board (knobs, sliders, touchscreen)
  - Audio board (ADC/DAC, balanced IO)
  - Power board (often isolated from main electronics)
- **Cabling:**  
  Shielded and color-coded; modular sub-assemblies.
- **Service features:**  
  Diagnostic headers, test points, self-test routines.
- **Observations:**  
  Well-labeled, some parts socketed for service.

### 1.5 Example: Yamaha Montage Teardown

- **Chassis:**  
  Sturdy, layered metal, with dedicated RF/EMI shields.
- **Boards:**  
  - DSP/SoC board (often with custom Yamaha chips)
  - Audio IO board
  - UI controller (with color display)
  - Power and fan modules
- **Cabling:**  
  FFC for displays, shielded for audio, lockable connectors.
- **Cooling:**  
  Dedicated fans, heat sinks, airflow channels.
- **Service features:**  
  Modular boards, clear labeling, some boards socketed.
- **Observations:**  
  Heavy duty, high-quality components, focus on reliability.

### 1.6 Example: MODX, Nord Stage, and Others

- **MODX:**  
  More integration, fewer boards, focus on cost reduction.
- **Nord Stage:**  
  Simpler, fewer features, high build quality, easy keybed access.
- **Commonalities:**  
  Integration of UI and main boards, use of standard form factors, service access through bottom panel.

### 1.7 Documenting Your Own Teardown

- **Step-by-step photos:**  
  Every screw, cable, and board.
- **Notes:**  
  Label connectors, note orientation, and any damage.
- **Drawings:**  
  Hand-draw or use CAD to map board layout.
- **Publish:**  
  Share on forums, blogs, or GitHub for others to learn.

### 1.8 Practice: Creating a Teardown Report

- Pick a modern (or old) device.
- Photograph every step, draw a block diagram, and write a summary on serviceability, modularity, and repair risks.

## 2. Field Feedback: Learning from Users and Technicians

### 2.1 What is Field Feedback? Sources and Value

- **Field feedback:**  
  Real-world reports from users, techs, and support teams about failures, pain points, and surprises.
- **Sources:**  
  - User forums (Gearslutz, Korgforums, YamahaMusicians)
  - Service centers and repair shops
  - Social media, YouTube, Reddit
  - Manufacturer’s own support and RMA records

### 2.2 User Forums, Service Bulletins, and Recalls

- **Forums:**  
  Find common complaints, recurring issues, tips, and hacks.
- **Service bulletins:**  
  Official manufacturer documents on known issues and fixes (e.g., keybed replacements, firmware patches).
- **Recalls:**  
  Rare, but critical: safety, fire risk, or major design flaws.

### 2.3 Typical Field Issues: Hardware, Software, and User Error

- **Hardware:**  
  Power supply failures, display issues, keybed/contact failures, loose connectors.
- **Software:**  
  Firmware bugs, freezes, MIDI or audio glitches, update issues.
- **User error:**  
  Misconnections, incorrect settings, unsupported updates.

### 2.4 Gathering and Analyzing Feedback

- **Logs and data:**  
  Collect error logs, serial numbers, usage patterns.
- **Triaging:**  
  Separate real bugs from “pilot error.”
- **Prioritization:**  
  Fix most common/severe issues first.
- **Tools:**  
  Bug trackers, spreadsheets, field service apps.

### 2.5 Incorporating Feedback into Design and Support

- **Rapid firmware updates:**  
  Fix bugs and add features based on real-world use.
- **Hardware revisions:**  
  Strengthen connectors, improve shielding, update power supplies.
- **Documentation and training:**  
  Update manuals, FAQs, and support bulletins.

### 2.6 Practice: Field Issue Log and Analysis

- Make a template for logging field issues: date, model, serial, symptoms, environment, fix.
- Analyze real or sample data for trends (e.g., “power board failure after 2 years”).

## 3. Support and Service: Lessons from the Field

### 3.1 The Role of Customer Support in Product Success

- **Beyond repair:**  
  Good support builds loyalty, reputation, and brand.
- **Feedback loop:**  
  Support teams are often first to spot design flaws.

### 3.2 Service Manuals, Parts, and Exploded Diagrams

- **Manuals:**  
  Essential for field techs; include schematics, parts lists, troubleshooting flowcharts.
- **Parts:**  
  Availability of replacements is key for long-term support.
- **Exploded diagrams:**  
  Show assembly for technicians, help with part ordering.

### 3.3 Warranty Policies and Field Repair

- **Warranty:**  
  Covers defects for a defined period; terms vary by region.
- **Field repair:**  
  Trained techs replace boards, displays, keybeds, etc.
- **Return-to-factory:**  
  For major defects or non-serviceable assemblies.

### 3.4 Building a Service Network: Local vs. Global

- **Local:**  
  Faster turnaround, language/cultural alignment.
- **Global:**  
  Consistency, economies of scale, but slower and costlier.
- **Hybrid:**  
  Regional centers with factory support.

### 3.5 Common Support Scenarios and Escalation Paths

- **First line:**  
  FAQ, email/phone support for user error, basic troubleshooting.
- **Second line:**  
  Trained techs for board swaps, calibration.
- **Escalation:**  
  Factory engineering for design bugs, recalls, or major faults.

### 3.6 Practice: Writing a Service FAQ

- Make a simple FAQ: power-up failure, no audio, stuck keys, firmware update, and contact info.
