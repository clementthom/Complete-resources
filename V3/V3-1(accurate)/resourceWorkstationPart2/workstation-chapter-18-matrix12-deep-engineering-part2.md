## 1. The Modulation Matrix: Hardware and Software Integration

### 1.1 What Is the Modulation Matrix?

- **Definition:** A system that allows any modulation source (LFO, envelope, velocity, aftertouch, pedal, etc.) to be routed to any destination (pitch, filter, VCA, pan, etc.) with a programmable amount.
- **Matrix 12 specifics:** 20 user-programmable mod slots per patch; 27 sources × 47 destinations.

### 1.2 Data Structures for Routing

- **Each mod slot is a structure:**
    - Source (ID/enum)
    - Destination (ID/enum)
    - Amount (signed, often -63 to +63 or -128 to +127)
    - Optional: Offset, scale, conditional logic

- **Typical C structure:**
    ```c
    typedef struct {
        uint8_t src;      // modulation source ID
        uint8_t dest;     // modulation destination ID
        int8_t amount;    // amount, signed
    } ModSlot;
    ```

- **Per patch:** Array of 20 ModSlot entries.

### 1.3 Implementing the Matrix in Firmware

- **At each processing tick:**
    1. Gather all current source values (LFOs, EGs, velocity, aftertouch, etc.).
    2. For each ModSlot:
        - Lookup source value
        - Scale by amount
        - Add to the destination accumulator (e.g., VCO pitch CV, VCF cutoff CV)
    3. After all slots, clamp/normalize destination values.
    4. Output final values to DAC/mux/S&H for each analog parameter.

- **Performance concern:** Must process all voices × all mod slots fast enough for real-time response (typically >1kHz update).

### 1.4 Real-Time Performance: CPU, DAC, and Timing

- **CPU:** Main loop or timer interrupt must be fast:
    - For 12 voices × 20 mod routes = 240 computations per tick.
    - Efficient code, use of lookup tables, and avoiding floating point helps.
- **DAC:** Multiplexed, so output must settle before S&H latches value. Use high-speed DAC and low-leakage S&H.
- **Timing:** Prioritize EG, LFO, and performance mod slots for lowest latency.

### 1.5 Limiting Aliasing and Artifacts

- **Update rate:** Minimum 1kHz for smooth LFO/EG; higher for pitch/VCF if modulated by audio-rate sources (rare).
- **Slew limiting:** Apply smoothing to avoid zipper noise when updating CVs.
- **Aliasing:** Use hardware or digital filtering for very fast modulations.

### 1.6 Example: Modulation Matrix in C Pseudocode

```c
#define MAX_VOICES 12
#define MOD_SLOTS 20
#define DEST_MAX 47

typedef struct {
    uint8_t src;
    uint8_t dest;
    int8_t amount;
} ModSlot;

typedef struct {
    ModSlot matrix[MOD_SLOTS];
    // Other patch data...
} Patch;

void update_mod_matrix(Patch *patch, Voice *voices, SourceValues *srcs) {
    for (int v = 0; v < MAX_VOICES; ++v) {
        int32_t dest_accum[DEST_MAX] = {0};
        for (int m = 0; m < MOD_SLOTS; ++m) {
            int16_t val = srcs->get(patch->matrix[m].src, v);
            int16_t amt = patch->matrix[m].amount;
            dest_accum[patch->matrix[m].dest] += (val * amt) >> 7; // scale
        }
        // Clamp, normalize, send to DAC/S&H for each destination
        send_cv_to_voice(v, dest_accum);
    }
}
```

- **Modern equivalents:**
    - STM32 (ARM Cortex M4/M7), NXP, Microchip PIC32, or even Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)
    - Needs: >=64kB RAM, >=128kB Flash, multiple UART/SPI/I2C, GPIO for panel and mux, timers for precise updates, USB/MIDI support

### 2.2 Main Loop, Interrupts, and Timing

- **Initialization:** Setup peripherals, load patch, calibrate voices.
- **Timer interrupt:** High-priority, runs LFOs, EGs, and updates S&H.
- **Main loop:** Handles UI, MIDI, patch changes, background tasks.

### 2.3 Voice Assignment and Polyphony Management

- **Voice allocation:** 
    - Maintains a table of active notes and which voice handles each.
    - Handles stealing (reassigning oldest/quietest voice if all in use).
    - Responds to keyboard, MIDI, and splits/layers.

### 2.4 Communication Between Digital and Analog Domains

- **DAC interface:** SPI or parallel; fast enough to update all S&H channels in <1ms.
- **Multiplexer control:** GPIO lines select channel; careful timing to avoid glitches.
- **Calibration:** Software stores offset/scale for each CV channel to compensate for analog drift.

### 2.5 Error Detection and Fail-Safes

- **Watchdog timers:** To catch firmware hangs.
- **ADC monitoring:** Read back reference voltages, power rails, temperature.
- **Voice mute:** Mute output if CVs go out of range or voice fails calibration.

### 2.6 Example: Scheduling and Task Breakdown

| Task         | Interval   | Priority  |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| LFO/EG update| 1 ms       | High      |
| Mod matrix   | 1 ms       | High      |
| DAC update   | 1 ms       | High      |
| UI scan      | 10 ms      | Medium    |
| MIDI poll    | 1 ms       | High      |
| Patch save   | On demand  | Low       |
| Diagnostics  | 100 ms     | Low       |
