## 1. Introduction: What is System Architecture in Embedded Music Workstations?

System architecture is the master plan for your workstation project.  
It determines:
- How hardware and software components interact and are separated
- How information flows (audio, MIDI, control, data)
- How you expand, debug, and maintain your design

### Why is System Architecture so Important?

- It’s the difference between a reliable, extensible instrument and a fragile prototype.
- It enables teamwork: well-defined interfaces mean multiple people can work at once.
- It reduces bugs by enforcing clear boundaries between responsibilities.
- It allows for future-proofing and upgrades (software, hardware, or both).

**Classic Example:**  
The Synclavier, Fairlight, and Emulator III each had a clear split between digital (synthesis, sequencing, storage) and analog (filters, mixers, output) — this made them both powerful and reliable.

## 2. Why Modularity is Essential

### 2.1 What is Modularity?

- The division of a system into independent, interchangeable parts (“modules”).
- Each module does one job and communicates through well-defined interfaces.

### 2.2 Modular Hardware

- **Analog Board(s):** Filter, VCA, mixer, output stage
- **Digital Board(s):** Processor, RAM, storage, digital I/O
- **I/O Board(s):** MIDI, USB, CV/Gate, touch, display
- **Power Supply:** Isolated, regulated voltages for each section

### 2.3 Modular Software

- **Audio Engine:** Synthesis, sampling, mixing
- **Sequencer:** Real-time, step, and pattern recording/playback
- **UI Layer:** Display, touch, knob and slider interpretation
- **Storage Layer:** File system, patch/sample management
- **Communication Layer:** MIDI, USB, networking

### 2.4 Benefits of Modularity

- **Parallel Development:** Hardware, UI, and audio engine can be worked on independently.
- **Testing:** Each module can be tested in isolation.
- **Upgradeability:** Swap out modules as technology or needs change.
- **Robustness:** Faults are contained to individual modules.

## 3. The Hardware/Software Split: Principles and Rationale

### 3.1 Why Split Hardware and Software?

- Hardware is expensive and hard to change after assembly.
- Software is flexible, upgradable, and can “fix” hardware limitations—or vice versa.
- Clear boundaries prevent accidental dependencies and reduce bugs.

### 3.2 What Goes in Hardware?

- **Real-time, latency-critical analog processing:** Filters, VCA, output stages
- **Physical interfaces:** Keys, sliders, touch, LEDs, screens
- **High-speed digital I/O:** Audio DAC/ADC, MIDI, USB

### 3.3 What Goes in Software?

- **Sound generation:** Oscillators, samplers, effects algorithms
- **Sequencing and automation**
- **User interface logic:** Menus, patch browsing, editing
- **Storage and preset management**
- **Networking, remote control, and updates**

### 3.4 Embedded vs. Host Software

- **Embedded:** Runs on your workstation’s CPU (Raspberry Pi, STM32, etc.)
- **Host:** Optional; runs on PC for advanced editing, backup, remote control

## 4. High-Level Block Diagrams: Classic and Modern Workstations

### 4.1 Classic Example: Fairlight CMI (Block Diagram)

**[ASCII Diagram]**

```

### 4.3 Key Information Flows

- **Control:** User input → CPU → parameter updates
- **Audio:** CPU → DAC → analog board → output
- **MIDI:** MIDI in/out directly to CPU and/or sequencer
- **Storage:** CPU ↔ SD card/USB ↔ patches, samples, sequences

### 7.2 Define Module Interfaces

- For each interface, specify:
  - Type (analog, digital, SPI, I2C, USB, etc.)
  - Data rate (e.g., audio sample rate, MIDI baud rate)
  - Direction (in/out/bidirectional)

### 7.3 Map Use Cases to Modules

## 8. Exercises

1. **Block Diagram Creation**
   - Draw (by hand or tool) a high-level block diagram of your planned workstation, labeling each module and connection.

2. **Module Inventory**
   - List all the hardware and software modules you anticipate needing. For each, write a one-sentence description of its role.

3. **Interface Specification**
   - Choose three pairs of modules (e.g., CPU ↔ analog board, CPU ↔ SD card, CPU ↔ display). For each, specify:
     - Physical connection type and protocol
     - Data format (e.g., 24-bit PCM, MIDI, I2C message)
     - Peak and typical data rate

4. **Use Case Mapping**
   - For the “live performance” and “sound design” scenarios above, write a short narrative tracing data flow through your architecture.

5. **Upgradability Reflection**
   - Identify at least two parts of your design you want to be upgradable or swappable in the future, and explain why.

6. **Classic Comparison**
   - Research how the Fairlight or Synclavier split their hardware and software. What lessons can you apply to your own design?
