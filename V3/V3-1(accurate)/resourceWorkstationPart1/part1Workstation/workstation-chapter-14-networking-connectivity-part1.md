## 1. Introduction: The Age of Connected Workstations

### 1.1 Why Networking Is Now Essential

- **Studio Integration:**  
  - Modern studios are distributed: hardware synths, DAWs, controllers, and patch libraries are networked for seamless workflow.
- **Live Performance:**  
  - Networked audio and MIDI allow for flexible stage layouts, remote mixing, and wireless control.
- **Education and Collaboration:**  
  - Teachers and students share patches and performances in real-time, across classrooms or continents.
- **Remote Support and Updates:**  
  - Devices are updated over the air (OTA), receive new content, and support is provided remotely.
- **Cloud and Mobile Integration:**  
  - Libraries sync to cloud, remote apps control hardware, and analytics drive improvements.

### 1.2 Use Cases: Studio, Stage, Education, and Collaboration

- **Studio:**  
  - Networked patch management, DAW integration, multi-user sound design.
- **Stage:**  
  - Distributed monitoring, wireless foot controllers, networked DMX/lighting, clustered synths.
- **Education:**  
  - Real-time performance sync, remote lessons, group projects.
- **Collaboration:**  
  - Shared projects, patch sync, real-time jam sessions with remote musicians.

## 2. MIDI Networking: MIDI 1.0, MIDI 2.0, and RTP-MIDI

### 2.1 MIDI 1.0 over DIN, USB, and Serial

- **DIN (5-pin):**  
  - 31.25 kbps, serial, robust but no hot-plug or power.
- **USB MIDI:**  
  - Host/device roles, 12 Mbps (Full Speed), class-compliant, supports multiple virtual cables/ports.
- **Serial/UART:**  
  - Used in embedded projects, low-level and direct; requires protocol framing and timing discipline.
- **Limitations:**  
  - Bandwidth, channel count, lack of meta or property exchange.

### 2.2 MIDI 2.0: Protocol, Profiles, and Property Exchange

- **Protocol:**  
  - 32-bit high-res data, per-note controller, polyphonic expression, bidirectional negotiation.
- **Profiles:**  
  - Device “personalities” (e.g., drawbar organ, analog synth) define parameter maps and behaviors.
- **Property Exchange:**  
  - Devices share names, icons, supported features, and patch lists with hosts.
- **Negotiation:**  
  - MIDI-CI protocol (Capability Inquiry): handshake, mode selection, fallback to MIDI 1.0.

### 2.3 RTP-MIDI: Architecture, Session Management, and Discovery

- **RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol):**  
  - Runs over UDP/IP, used for streaming time-sensitive data (audio, MIDI).
- **RTP-MIDI/AppleMIDI:**  
  - Encapsulates MIDI messages, adds timestamps, bundles, session setup/teardown.
- **Session Management:**  
  - Peer discovery (mDNS, Bonjour/ZeroConf), session negotiation, recovery from disconnects.
- **Benefits:**  
  - Low-latency, scalable (multiple endpoints), robust against network jitter.

### 2.4 MIDI-CI and Backward Compatibility

- **MIDI-CI:**  
  - Devices use System Exclusive (SysEx) messages for capability negotiation.
- **Backward compatibility:**  
  - Devices can run in MIDI 1.0 mode if 2.0 not supported; auto-detect and adapt.
- **Embedded Considerations:**  
  - MIDI 2.0 stacks are larger and require more RAM/flash than MIDI 1.0.

### 2.5 Timing, Latency, and Jitter in Networked MIDI

- **Timing:**  
  - MIDI 2.0 supports 32-bit timestamps; RTP-MIDI bundles messages with time tags.
- **Latency:**  
  - USB MIDI: <1ms; RTP-MIDI: 1–5ms typical on LAN; BLE MIDI: 10–20ms.
- **Jitter:**  
  - Network-induced variation in timing; RTP-MIDI uses jitter buffers to compensate.
- **Testing:**  
  - Use timestamped loopback, hardware analyzers, or software tools to measure.

### 2.6 Multi-Client, Multi-Session, and Virtual Ports

- **Multi-client:**  
  - Multiple apps can open virtual MIDI ports (e.g., MacOS, iOS, Linux ALSA).
- **Multi-session:**  
  - RTP-MIDI supports multiple peer sessions; each with its own clock, buffer, and routing.
- **Virtual Ports:**  
  - Abstract hardware and network MIDI endpoints; support dynamic creation/destruction at runtime.

### 2.7 Practice: Embedded RTP-MIDI Stack Implementation

- **Stack architecture:**  
  - UDP/IP socket, RTP framing, session state, MIDI event queue.
- **Session negotiation:**  
  - Implement mDNS/Bonjour for auto-discovery, handshake for session setup.
- **Buffering:**  
  - Jitter buffer for incoming/outgoing packets, per-session state.
- **Error handling:**  
  - Lost packet detection, recovery, session timeout/reconnect.
- **Test:**  
  - Interop with DAWs (Logic, Cubase, Ableton), iOS/Android apps, and hardware modules.

## 3. Audio over IP: Protocols and Implementations

### 3.1 Standards: Dante, AVB/TSN, AES67, Ravenna, DIY

- **Dante:**  
  - Proprietary, ultra-low latency, plug-and-play, widely used in pro audio (requires Dante chip/license).
- **AVB/TSN:**  
  - IEEE 802.1, deterministic Ethernet, prioritized audio/video streams, hardware switch support required.
- **AES67/Ravenna:**  
  - Open standards, interoperable, used in broadcast and large venues.
- **DIY/Custom:**  
  - RTP/UDP or even raw UDP for simple use cases (home studios, DIY embedded).

### 3.2 Concepts: Packetization, Clock Sync, and Multicast

- **Packetization:**  
  - Audio broken into frames (64–256 samples typical), encapsulated in UDP/RTP packets.
- **Clock Sync:**  
  - PTP (Precision Time Protocol, IEEE 1588) for sample-accurate alignment across devices.
- **Multicast:**  
  - Efficient one-to-many streaming; requires managed switches with IGMP snooping.

### 3.3 Embedded Audio-over-IP: Hardware and Software Requirements

- **Hardware:**  
  - Fast MCU/SoC with MAC+PHY (Ethernet), enough RAM for audio buffers, DMA for packet and audio.
- **Software:**  
  - Lightweight TCP/IP (lwIP, FreeRTOS+TCP), RTP/UDP, jitter buffer, optional PTP.
- **Integration:**  
  - Must not block audio ISR; network stack runs in background task or RTOS thread.

### 3.4 Buffering, Dropout Recovery, and Real-Time Constraints

- **Jitter buffer:**  
  - Absorbs network delay variance; size is tradeoff between latency and dropout risk.
- **Dropout recovery:**  
  - Zero-fill, repeat previous, or interpolate missing data.
- **Real-time constraints:**  
  - Must process each packet before its play deadline; late = glitch/dropout.

### 3.5 Security, QoS, and Network Segmentation for Audio

- **Security:**  
  - DTLS/SRTP for encrypted audio; lightweight for embedded, but plan for CPU cost.
- **QoS (Quality of Service):**  
  - Ethernet VLANs and DSCP marking for audio packets; prevents audio dropouts in mixed networks.
- **Segmentation:**  
  - Separate audio/control VLANs from general data for reliability and security.

### 3.6 Practice: Minimal Audio-over-IP Stack with Jitter Buffer

- **Step 1:**  
  - Use lwIP or FreeRTOS+TCP for UDP sockets on an STM32/ESP32.
- **Step 2:**  
  - Implement simple RTP framing and per-packet timestamp.
- **Step 3:**  
  - Circular buffer (jitter buffer) for incoming audio frames.
- **Step 4:**  
  - Handle packet loss: zero-fill and log dropouts.
- **Step 5:**  
  - Measure end-to-end latency, jitter, and packet loss rates.

- **Pairing, reconnect:**  
  - Handle lost connections, auto-reconnect, and device whitelisting.

### 4.4 Stack Integration: Priority, Power, and Coexistence

- **Priority:**  
  - Audio and MIDI must preempt background network tasks.
