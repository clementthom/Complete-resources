## 1. Filesystem Repair and Recovery

### 1.1 Common Filesystem Corruption Scenarios

- **Unclean shutdowns:**  
  - Power loss or crash during write leads to partial or corrupt file tables.
- **Bad sectors/blocks:**  
  - NAND, SD, or SSD develops unreadable areas; files or metadata lost.
- **Wear-out:**  
  - Exceeded write cycles, especially on consumer flash.
- **Firmware bugs:**  
  - Storage controller or OS bugs overwrite or lose metadata.
- **User error:**  
  - Deleting or overwriting files accidentally.

### 1.2 Tools and Algorithms for Repair

- **Consistency checkers:**  
  - Scan directory and file tables for orphaned or inconsistent entries (e.g., fsck, chkdsk).
- **Journaling replay:**  
  - Replay incomplete journal entries to roll forward or back to last consistent state.
- **Backup Superblocks:**  
  - ext2/3/4 store multiple superblock copies; can recover from primary loss.
- **Lost+found:**  
  - Orphaned files are placed in a recovery directory for user review.

### 1.3 Recovering Lost, Deleted, or Corrupt Files

- **File undelete:**  
  - Scan filesystem for orphaned but unallocated blocks, reconstruct lost files.
- **Data carving:**  
  - Analyze raw storage for known headers/footers (WAV, AIFF) to rebuild lost files.
- **Redundant copies:**  
  - Use mirrored/backup copies if available (RAID1, cloud).
- **Automated recovery:**  
  - On boot, system can attempt to auto-repair and log errors for user.

### 1.4 Journaling, Checksums, and Redundant Metadata

- **Journaling:**  
  - Robust filesystems log all changes; on crash, replay or discard incomplete ops.
- **Checksums:**  
  - Metadata and file data blocks can be checksummed (CRC32, SHA256) to detect corruption.
- **Redundant metadata:**  
  - Multiple directory tables, backup superblocks, or mirrored partition tables.

### 1.5 User Notification and Recovery UI

- **On error:**  
  - Alert user, log error, prompt for repair or backup restore.
- **Recovery wizard:**  
  - Step-by-step UI for scanning, identifying, and restoring lost files.
- **Progress and risk reporting:**  
  - Show what was fixed, what is unrecoverable, and recommended next steps.

### 1.6 Practical: Building a Filesystem Self-Check and Repair Tool

- Implement a tool that scans for orphaned files, cross-checks directory tables, and reconstructs lost+found.
- Include reporting, undo, and safe rollback features.

## 2. Distributed and Networked Storage

### 2.1 Network Filesystem Protocols: NFS, SMB, WebDAV

- **NFS (Network File System):**  
  - UNIX/Linux standard, works well for LAN, stateless, can be tuned for audio.
- **SMB (Samba/CIFS):**  
  - Windows/Mac/embedded support, user authentication, wide compatibility.
- **WebDAV:**  
  - HTTP-based, good for remote/cloud storage, can be slow for large files.

### 2.2 Network Storage Devices: NAS, SAN, iSCSI

- **NAS (Network Attached Storage):**  
  - File-level access over NFS/SMB; easy backup, sharing, and expansion.
- **SAN (Storage Area Network):**  
  - Block-level access, high speed, used in pro studios.
- **iSCSI:**  
  - Maps remote disk as local block device; can boot/work remotely.

### 2.3 Peer-to-Peer and Mesh Storage Concepts

- **P2P storage:**  
  - Devices share and replicate files directly; no central server.
- **Mesh:**  
  - Multiple devices cooperate to form a resilient, distributed file system.
- **Use cases:**  
  - Collaborative studios, distributed live rigs.

### 2.4 Synchronization, Caching, and Offline Access

- **File sync:**  
  - Rsync, unison, Syncthing for keeping local/remote in sync.
- **Caching:**  
  - Keep local copies of remote files for speed and offline work.
- **Conflict resolution:**  
  - UI for merging edits, keeping both versions, or prompting user.

### 2.5 Latency, Bandwidth, and QoS for Audio Applications

- **Latency:**  
  - Network file access adds delay; must pre-buffer for streaming.
- **Bandwidth:**  
  - Gigabit Ethernet or faster for multi-track sample streaming; WiFi may be too slow for large sessions.
- **QoS (Quality of Service):**  
  - Prioritize audio data; avoid dropouts due to network congestion.

### 2.6 Redundancy, Failover, and Multi-Device Consistency

- **Mirroring:**  
  - RAID1, distributed file systems, or cloud sync for redundancy.
- **Failover:**  
  - Automatically switch to backup server or local cache if network fails.
- **Consistency:**  
  - Ensure all devices see same data; use file versioning and locking.

### 2.7 Security and Authentication in Network Storage

- **Authentication:**  
  - User/password, Kerberos, SSH keys, or OAuth.
- **Encryption:**  
  - SSL/TLS for data in transit; at-rest encryption for sensitive files.
- **Access control:**  
  - Per-user, per-directory permissions.

### 2.8 Example: Workstation with Shared Sample Library over LAN

- Configure NAS with NFS/SMB share for samples.
- Workstation mounts share at boot, caches hot samples locally.
- Sync tool periodically updates local cache and resolves conflicts.

## 3. Immutable Storage for Archival and Versioning

### 3.1 Principles of Immutable Storage

- **Write-once, read-many:**  
  - Files never modified after creation; new versions are new files.
- **Benefits:**  
  - Prevents accidental/intentional overwrites, ensures auditability, and enables true versioning.

### 3.2 Write-Once Media: CD-R, WORM, Optical, and Archival Flash

- **CD-R/DVD-R:**  
  - Legacy, but still used for long-term archives.
- **WORM:**  
  - Write once, read many; used for compliance/logging.
- **Archival flash:**  
  - Special flash with built-in error correction and long retention.

### 3.3 Immutable Filesystem Approaches: ZFS Snapshots, S3 Versioning, IPFS

- **ZFS snapshots:**  
  - Filesystem-level snapshots allow rollback and true versioning.
- **S3 versioning:**  
  - Every upload creates new version; prior versions never lost unless deleted.
- **IPFS (InterPlanetary FS):**  
  - Content-addressable, distributed, and immutable by design.

### 3.4 Deduplication and Compression for Long-Term Storage

- **Deduplication:**  
  - Only store unique data blocks; saves space with large sample libraries and repeated content.
- **Compression:**  
  - Archive files with lossless compression; consider impact on future compatibility.

### 3.5 Verifying Integrity Over Decades: Parity, Checksums, Blockchain Anchoring

- **Parity/erasure coding:**  
  - Extra blocks allow recovery from bit rot or media loss.
- **Checksums:**  
  - Regularly re-validate all files, log corruption.
- **Blockchain anchoring:**  
  - Store hashes in public ledger for proof of integrity and timestamp.

### 3.6 Migration Strategies for Obsolete Media/Formats

- **Media refresh:**  
  - Migrate archives to new disks/media every 5–10 years.
- **Format migration:**  
  - Convert files to new, open formats before old ones become unreadable.
- **Verification:**  
  - Compare checksums before/after migration.

### 3.7 Legal, Forensic, and Compliance Considerations

- **Audit trails:**  
  - Immutable logs of all changes.
- **Compliance:**  
  - Some industries require WORM storage for regulatory reasons.
- **Forensics:**  
  - Maintain chain-of-custody and proof of non-tampering.
