## 1. Introduction to Project Management for Makers

In the world of music technology and embedded electronics, project management is not just for big companies.  
It is the difference between a successful, enjoyable project and a frustrating, unfinished one.

**What is Project Management?**  
Project management means organizing your goals, tasks, code, hardware designs, and documentation so that:
- You (and your collaborators) always know what to do next.
- Work is tracked and recoverable—mistakes can be fixed, changes can be rolled back.
- The project is easy to understand for new contributors (including “future you”).
- You can scale from a one-person build to a collaborative open-source community.

**Why is it important here?**
- Hardware and software must remain in sync: a change in a circuit might require new firmware and updated documentation.
- Modern workstation projects have hundreds of files: code, schematics, BOMs, tests, audio samples, and user manuals.
- You will want to experiment, make mistakes, and try new ideas—without losing previous work or breaking the main build.

---

## 2. Why Project Management Matters in Complex DIY Electronics

Imagine you just finished coding a new feature, but your friend has made changes to the hardware schematic.
Meanwhile, another collaborator has fixed a critical bug in the firmware, but it conflicts with your changes.

Without project management:
- Files are lost or overwritten.
- Bugs reappear after being fixed.
- Features break unexpectedly.
- Newcomers cannot contribute, and you cannot scale up.

With project management:
- All work is tracked and recoverable.
- Mistakes are easy to fix (just roll back changes).
- Progress is clear, and everyone knows what’s next.
- Collaboration is smooth, and new contributors can join quickly.

**In the context of this course:**  
You will use modern tools and workflows to manage your workstation project like a pro, even as a beginner.

## 3. Fundamentals of Version Control

### Why Version Control?

Version control lets you:
- Save “snapshots” of your project at any point.
- Experiment with features without risking your main code.
- Collaborate—multiple people can work on the project at once.
- Review and understand the history of every change.

### Git: Concepts & Workflows

**Git** is the most popular version control system, and the backbone of GitHub and GitLab.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Repository (repo):** The main project folder, tracked by Git.
- **Commit:** A saved snapshot of your code/files at a point in time.
- **Branch:** A parallel line of development (e.g., “feature-X”, “bugfix-1”).
- **Merge:** Combining changes from two branches.
- **Remote:** An online copy of the repo (e.g., on GitHub).
- **Clone:** Downloading a repo to your computer.
- **Pull:** Updating your local repo with changes from the remote.
- **Push:** Uploading your changes to the remote repo.

#### Example: Setting Up a New Git Repo

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
# 1. Create a new project folder
mkdir workstation-project
cd workstation-project

# 2. Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# 3. Create a README file
echo "# My Workstation Project" > README.md

# 4. Add files to the staging area
git add README.md

# 5. Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add README"

# 6. Create a new repo on GitHub (via the website), then link it:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/workstation-project.git

# 7. Push your local repo to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

**Tip:**  
Always start every project with a README and a LICENSE file.

---

### Branching, Merging, and Pull Requests

A **branch** lets you work on new features or fixes without affecting the main code.

- The default branch is usually called `main` or `master`.
- Create branches for features:  
  `git checkout -b feature-oscillator-engine`
- Merge completed features back into `main`:
  `git checkout main`
  `git merge feature-oscillator-engine`
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** On GitHub, you can request a review before merging.

#### Resolving Merge Conflicts

When two people change the same file, Git may not know how to combine them.  
A **merge conflict** occurs—Git marks the places in the file for you to fix manually.

```diff
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your change here
=======
Their change here
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

Edit the file, pick or blend the changes, then:

```bash
git add yourfile.c
git commit
```

---

### Best Practices for Commit Messages

- Use short, descriptive summaries: “Add oscillator engine basic structure”
- Explain why, not just what, in the body: “Refactored to allow flexible polyphony”
- Reference issues/PRs when relevant: “Fixes #12”

---

### Using Platforms: GitHub & GitLab

- **GitHub** is the most popular for open source.
- **GitLab** is similar, with more built-in CI/CD for free.
- Both provide:
  - Issue tracking
  - Pull/merge requests
  - Wikis and documentation
  - Project boards and milestones

---

## 4. Directory & File Structure Best Practices

### Organizing a Large Hardware/Software Project

A clear, maintainable directory structure makes your project easy to understand and extend.

#### Example: Workstation Directory Tree

```text
workstation-project/
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── .gitignore
├── docs/                # Documentation, diagrams, manuals
│   ├── architecture.md
│   ├── user-guide.md
│   └── images/
├── hardware/            # Schematics, PCBs, BOMs
│   ├── analog/
│   ├── digital/
│   ├── pcb/
│   └── simulation/
├── src/                 # C source code
│   ├── main.c
│   ├── audio/
│   │   ├── oscillator.c
│   │   ├── filter.c
│   │   ├── sampler.c
│   │   └── effects.c
│   ├── midi/
│   ├── sequencer/
│   ├── ui/
│   └── utils/
├── include/             # Header files
│   ├── audio.h
│   ├── midi.h
│   └── ...
├── tests/               # Test code
│   └── audio_tests.c
├── samples/             # Example audio samples
├── scripts/             # Helper scripts (build, CI, etc.)
├── .github/             # GitHub Actions, issue templates
│   ├── workflows/
│   └── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
└── projects/            # Example user projects, patches
```

- **Tip:** Use `docs/` for all design documentation, not just user manuals.
- Place simulation files (SPICE, KiCAD) in `hardware/simulation/`.
- Use a `.gitignore` to avoid tracking build artifacts, temp files, etc.

---

### Using README, LICENSE, and Documentation

- **README.md**: Project overview, key features, setup instructions.
- **LICENSE**: Open source license (MIT, GPL, etc.).
- **docs/**: In-depth technical and user documentation.
- **images/**: Diagrams, schematics, block diagrams for clarity.

---

## 5. Issue Tracking & Documentation

### Writing Effective Issues & Bug Reports

- **Clear title:** “Oscillator module crashes on high note velocity”
- **Steps to reproduce:** List step-by-step actions.
- **Expected/actual behavior:** What should happen? What did happen?
- **Screenshots or logs:** If possible, add visuals or error messages.
- **Labels:** Use labels (bug, enhancement, hardware, urgent) for clarity.

### Labels, Milestones, and Project Boards

- **Labels:** Categorize issues for filtering and prioritization.
- **Milestones:** Group issues/PRs by project phase or release.
- **Boards:** Kanban-style drag-and-drop for planning (e.g., “To Do”, “In Progress”, “Done”).

### Wikis and Automated Documentation

- **Wikis:** For long-lived guides, FAQs, and how-tos.
- **Auto-docs:** Tools like Doxygen can generate API docs from comments in your code.

---

## 6. Collaboration: Working with Others

### Forking, Cloning, and Contributions

- **Forking:** Copy a repo to your account (common in open source).
- **Cloning:** Download a repo to your computer.
- **Pull Requests:** Propose changes to someone else’s repo.
- **Contributing Guidelines:** A `CONTRIBUTING.md` file sets expectations for code style, PR process, etc.

### Code Reviews & Constructive Feedback

- Invite others to review your code before merging.
- Be positive: focus on code and improvement, not personal criticism.
- Use inline comments for specific lines or blocks.

### Communication Tools

- **Issues:** For bugs and feature requests.
- **Discussions:** For ideas, questions, or design debates.
- **Chat:** Use platforms like Discord, Matrix, or Gitter for real-time collaboration.

### Open Source Communities & Etiquette

- Be welcoming, patient, and respectful.
- Document your decisions.
- Credit contributors in release notes and documentation.

---

## 7. Release Management

### Tagging, Releases, and Changelogs

- **Tags:** Mark specific commits as releases (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
- **Releases:** Packaged versions for users to download.
- **Changelogs:** Human-readable summary of what changed in each release.

### Semantic Versioning

- **Format:** MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 2.1.0)
  - **MAJOR:** Breaking changes
  - **MINOR:** New features, backward compatible
  - **PATCH:** Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Testing & Quality Gates

- **Automated tests:** Run on each push or PR (continuous integration).
- **Manual tests:** Hardware checks, breadboarding, listening tests.

---

## 8. Managing Hardware and Firmware Projects

### Tracking Hardware Versions

- Update schematic and PCB files with version numbers.
- Use tags/releases in Git for hardware milestones.

### PCB and Schematic Repositories

- Store KiCAD and SPICE files in the repo.
- Use clear naming: `oscillator_v1.0.sch`, `filter_v2.1.pcb`.

### BOM Management (Bill of Materials)

- Keep BOM as a spreadsheet (`.csv`) or markdown table.
- Include part numbers, suppliers, prices, and alternatives.
- Update BOM with each hardware revision.

### Synchronizing Hardware and Firmware Changes

- When hardware changes (e.g., new DAC), update firmware and document in changelog.
- Use issues/PRs to track changes across hardware and software.

   ```

3. **Create standard directories:**
   ```bash
   mkdir src include docs hardware tests samples scripts .github
   mkdir hardware/analog hardware/digital hardware/pcb hardware/simulation
   mkdir docs/images
   ```

4. **Create a LICENSE file:**
   - Choose a license (MIT, GPL, Apache, etc.)
   - Add it as `LICENSE`

5. **Create a .gitignore:**
   ```text
   *.o
   *.exe
   build/
   __pycache__/
   .DS_Store
   ```

6. **Create your first C source and header files:**
   ```bash
   touch src/main.c include/main.h
   ```
