## 1. Introduction: Persistent Setups and User Experience

A true workstation is not just a sound engine — it’s a musical environment:
- You need to save, recall, and manage complex setups with dozens of parts, layers, routings, and macros.
- You want to build performances and scenes for live use, with instant switching and zero interruption.
- A beginner-friendly but deep UI is crucial for exploring and editing.
- Patch sharing and community-driven banks multiply the value for every user.

**Why is this hard?**
- Every parameter, mapping, part, and macro must be tracked and stored.
- Upgrades and bug-fixes must preserve old setups (versioning).
- UI must balance deep editing with quick access for performance.
- Security and compatibility are vital for community sharing.

## 2. Persistent Scene, Setup, and Performance Management

### 2.1 Concepts: Scene, Setup, Performance, Patch

- **Patch:** A single sound/program (one part or layer).
- **Performance:** A multi-part/layer setup, with all splits, routings, macros, and FX.
- **Scene:** A snapshot of all engine state (parts, parameters, automation, mixer, etc.).
- **Setup:** The entire system configuration (performances, audio/MIDI/CV routing, user prefs).

**Typical Hierarchy:**
```
Setup
 ├── Performances (Scenes)
 │    ├── Parts (Patches)
 │    │    ├── Layers/Zones
 │    │    └── Controllers/Macros
 │    └── Automation, Routing, FX
 └── Global Settings (audio, MIDI, user prefs)
```

### 2.2 Data Structures for Persistent State

- Use nested structs/classes for performance, part, patch, and controller mapping.
- Store as binary, JSON, XML, or custom format.
- Include version fields for future compatibility.

**C Pseudocode:**
```c
typedef struct {
    int id;
    char name[32];
    Part parts[MAX_PARTS];
    Macro macros[MAX_MACROS];
    Automation automation[MAX_AUTOM];
    // ... FX, routing, etc.
} Performance;

typedef struct {
    Performance performances[MAX_PERF];
    int num_performances;
    GlobalSettings settings;
    // ... user prefs, favorites, etc.
} Setup;
```

### 2.3 Saving and Loading Workstation Setups

- On save: serialize all relevant structs, write to flash, SD card, or file.
- On load: validate file, check version, migrate/convert if needed.
- Provide fast access (index) for hundreds/thousands of patches.

### 2.4 Versioning, Backups, and Migration

- Add `version` fields to all persistent structures.
- When loading, auto-upgrade or warn if new/old version detected.
- Allow backup/restore of all user data.

### 2.5 User Stories: Real Use Cases

- **Live:** Instantly switch between scenes with zero audio dropout.
- **Studio:** Recall a full setup for a song — all parts, automation, and routings.
- **Practice:** Save a custom layered split for drills, recall with one button.
- **Upgrade:** After firmware update, user’s scenes/patches still work.

## 3. User Interface for Multi-Timbral Engines

### 3.1 Requirements for Pro-Grade UI

- Fast, intuitive navigation: access any part, layer, or macro in 1-2 actions.
- Overview: See all active parts, layers, and key parameters at a glance.
- Deep editing: Drill down to any parameter, routing, or mapping.
- Visual feedback: Display polyphony, CPU, memory, resource allocation.
- Live safety: Prevent accidental patch changes or destructive edits.
- Customizable: User can set favorites, quick access, and UI themes.

### 3.2 Overview Screens and Deep Edit Pages

- **Overview:** Show all parts/layers, active notes, parameter snapshots, FX routing.
- **Deep Edit:** Full parameter set for current part/layer, controller assignments, macro mapping.

**UI Example:**
```
[Performance Overview]
------------------------------------------------
| Part | Layer | Name      | Poly | Macro | FX |
|------|-------|-----------|------|-------|----|
|  1   |  1    | Piano     |  8   |  M1   | R  |
|  2   |  1    | Strings   |  8   |  M2   | R  |
|  2   |  2    | Pad       |  4   |  M2   | D  |
| ...  | ...   | ...       | ...  | ...   | ...|
------------------------------------------------
```

### 3.3 Fast Navigation: Scenes, Parts, Layers

- Assign buttons/encoders for fast switching between scenes and parts.
- Long-press or double-tap for deep edit; single tap for quick select.

### 3.4 Visual Feedback: Polyphony, Resource, Routing

- **Polyphony meters:** Per-part/layer indicators, total usage.
- **Resource meters:** CPU, memory, FX load.
- **Routing diagrams:** Show signal flow from input to output.

### 3.5 Live Editing and Macro Controls

- **Macro sliders/knobs:** Instantly tweak multiple parameters.
- **Snapshot/undo:** Allow rapid experimentation live.
- **Touchscreen support:** Drag-to-assign controls, XY pads.

### 3.6 Touch, Encoder, and MIDI Controller Integration

- Support touch, rotary encoders, faders, and external MIDI controllers.
- User-configurable mappings for all major UI functions.

## 4. Automation and Advanced Modulation

### 4.1 Recording and Playback of Parameter Changes

- **Automation lane:** Timeline of parameter changes (draw, record, or import).
- **Real-time automation:** Capture all knob/pad moves live.

### 4.2 Automation Lanes, Curves, and Scenes

- Multiple lanes per part/layer (e.g., cutoff, volume, FX send).
- Draw or record curves, step edits, or continuous control.
- Save with scene or performance, recall instantly.

### 4.3 Automation vs. Modulation: What’s the Difference?

- **Modulation:** Real-time, often periodic (LFO, envelope, random, macro).
- **Automation:** Recorded or drawn changes over time (like in a DAW).
- Both can be combined (e.g., modulate an automated parameter).

### 4.4 Real-Time Automation Recording and Editing

- Record all user actions (knobs, faders, macros) to automation lanes.
- Play back in sync with sequencer or external clock.
- Edit automation curves on UI or via external app.

### 4.5 Advanced Modulation Sources

- **LFOs:** Multi-shape, syncable, per-part/layer.
- **Envelopes:** Multi-stage, assignable to any destination.
- **Macros:** Map one macro to many destinations; curve/scale each mapping.
- **Random/Chaos:** Sample-and-hold, smooth random, chaos oscillators.

### 4.6 UI and API for Automation Editing

- Timeline view: select, zoom, edit curves and points.
- Assign automation to any parameter (drag-and-drop or menu).
- Support for external editing/automation via API (OSC, MIDI CC, web UI).

- Compatibility: forward/backward versioning, migration tools.
- Embed metadata: author, description, tags, version, dependencies.

### 5.2 Import/Export Tools and Metadata

- User can export patches/setups/scenes to file or cloud.
- Import from file, USB, SD card, or network.

- Browse by category, author, date, popularity.
- Tagging for genre, mood, instrument type.
- Favorites: User can star patches for quick recall.

### 5.4 Online Sharing: Community Repositories

- Built-in browser for curated patch banks.
- Option to download, preview, and rate patches.
- Support for open patch bank standards (e.g., DecentSampler, SFZ).

### 5.5 Curating, Rating, and Moderating Patches

- User ratings (stars, likes, comments).
- Moderation tools: flag bad/inappropriate content.
- Featured/curated picks by admins or power users.

### 5.6 Security and Safety

- Sandboxing: Load patches in a safe environment, prevent code injection.
- File validation: Check for corruption, invalid/malicious data.
- Backup/restore before importing new community banks.
