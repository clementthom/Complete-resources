### 1. Why C? — The Language of Hardware and Workstations

#### 1.1 A Brief History

- **C was created in the early 1970s** by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs.
- Designed for operating systems (UNIX), it became the foundation of almost all system software.
- Nearly every embedded system, real-time audio device, and workstation is coded in C (or C++ built on C).

#### 1.2 Why Not Python/JavaScript/Java?

- **C compiles to native machine code:** No interpreter, no virtual machine—just speed.
- **Direct access to memory and hardware:** You control every byte, every bit.
- **Predictable performance:** Crucial for real-time audio and hardware drivers.
- **Portability:** C compilers exist for virtually every chip.

#### 1.3 C in Synths and Workstations

- The Synclavier, Fairlight, modern DAWs, and even Linux audio drivers are all written in C.
- You’ll use C to program everything from the synth engine to the user interface, from file systems to hardware control.

### 2. How C Works: Compilation, Linking, and Execution

#### 2.1 The Compilation Pipeline

1. **Preprocessing:** Handles `#include`, `#define`, and other macros.
2. **Compilation:** Converts source code (`.c`) into object code (`.o`).
3. **Linking:** Combines object files and libraries into an executable.

#### 2.2 Example: Building a Program

Suppose you have:

- `main.c`
- `oscillator.c`
- `oscillator.h`

**Compile and link:**
```bash
gcc -c main.c      # produces main.o
gcc -c oscillator.c # produces oscillator.o
gcc main.o oscillator.o -o synth
```

> **Exercise:** Try this with your own "hello world" and a simple oscillator module.

#### 2.3 Why Does This Matter?

- **You must understand the build process** to manage large projects, link libraries, and debug errors.
- **Makefiles** (discussed later) automate these steps for you.

### 3. The Structure of a C Program

#### 3.1 The Anatomy

Every C program has:

- **Includes:** Libraries and headers (`#include <stdio.h>`)
- **Global variables/constants**
- **Functions:** Including `main()`, the entry point

**Example:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int global_variable = 42;

void greet() {
    printf("Hello, Workstation Builder!\n");
}

int main() {
    greet();
    printf("Global variable: %d\n", global_variable);
    return 0;
}
```

#### 3.2 Comments and Documentation

- Single line: `// This is a comment`
- Multi-line: 
  ```c
  /*
   * This is a longer comment
   * explaining what this function does.
   */
  ```

> **Tip:** Always comment WHY, not just WHAT, especially in complex projects.

### 4. Variables, Types, and Data Storage in Memory

#### 4.1 Basic Types

- `int` — integer
- `float` — single-precision floating point
- `double` — double-precision floating point
- `char` — single character (also used for bytes)
- `unsigned`, `short`, `long` — variations

**Example:**
```c
int age = 30;
float frequency = 440.0f;
double sampleRate = 44100.0;
char note = 'A';
unsigned int voices = 16;
```

#### 4.2 Size and Ranges

- Always check type sizes for portability!
- Use `sizeof()` to check:
  ```c
  printf("%lu\n", sizeof(int));
  ```

#### 4.3 Integer vs Floating Point

- Use `int` for counters, indices, state machines.
- Use `float`/`double` for audio, frequency, modulation.

#### 4.4 Constants and `#define`

- Constants: `const int maxVoices = 16;`
- Macros: `#define PI 3.141592653589793`

> **Best practice:** Prefer `const` for type safety.

### 5. Operators and Expressions

#### 5.1 Arithmetic

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`

#### 5.2 Assignment and Increment

- `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `++`, `--`

#### 5.3 Comparison

- `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

#### 5.4 Logical

- `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)

#### 5.5 Bitwise (Vital for Embedded/Audio)

- `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `^` (XOR), `~` (NOT), `<<` (shift left), `>>` (shift right)

**Example:**
```c
unsigned char flags = 0x0F; // 00001111
flags |= 0x10; // Set bit 4
flags &= ~0x02; // Clear bit 1
```

#### 5.6 Practice

- Write expressions to toggle, set, or clear bits in a register—essential for controlling hardware.

---

### 6. Control Flow: `if`, `else`, `switch`, Loops

#### 6.1 Conditional Statements

```c
if (frequency > 1000.0f) {
    printf("High frequency!\n");
} else {
    printf("Normal frequency.\n");
}
```

#### 6.2 Switch Statement

```c
switch (waveform) {
    case 0: /* Sine */ break;
    case 1: /* Square */ break;
    default: break;
}
```

#### 6.3 Loops

- `for`, `while`, `do...while`

**Example:**
```c
for (int i = 0; i < voices; i++) {
    // Process each voice
}
```

#### 6.4 Breaking and Continuing

- `break` to exit loops or switch
- `continue` to skip to next iteration

---

### 7. Functions: Definition, Declaration, Scope

#### 7.1 Defining Functions

```c
float get_frequency(int midiNote) {
    return 440.0f * powf(2, (midiNote - 69) / 12.0f);
}
```

#### 7.2 Function Prototypes

- Declarations go in headers:
  ```c
  float get_frequency(int midiNote);
  ```

#### 7.3 Arguments and Return Values

- Pass by value (default), or by reference using pointers (see next part for pointers/deep dive).

#### 7.4 Scope

- Local: declared inside functions
- Global: declared outside all functions (use sparingly!)

---

### 8. Practice Section 1: Your First Real C Programs

#### 8.1 Hello Workstation

Write a program that:
- Prints “Initializing Workstation!”
- Prompts the user for number of voices
- Prints a welcome message showing the number

**Sample Code:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int voices;
    printf("Initializing Workstation!\n");
    printf("Enter number of voices: ");
    scanf("%d", &voices);
    printf("You selected %d voices.\n", voices);
    return 0;
}
```

#### 8.2 Simple Waveform Switch

Write a program that:
- Asks for a waveform type (0=sine, 1=square, 2=saw)
- Prints the name of the waveform

### 9. Exercises

1. **Variables and Types**
   - Declare variables for all workstation parameters you can think of (voices, sample rate, patch name, etc.).
2. **Bitwise Operations**
   - Write code to set/clear/toggle bits in a status register.
3. **Loops and Functions**
   - Write a function to print all MIDI note numbers and their frequencies (use the formula above).
4. **Input/Output**
   - Extend the “Hello Workstation” to ask for a patch name and print it back to the user.
5. **Reading Code**
   - Find a simple open-source C audio project online and try to identify main, function definitions, variable declarations.
