## 1. Advanced MIDI 2.0 and MPE Features

### 1.1 MIDI 2.0 Protocol: Packets, Resolution, Profiles, and Property Exchange

- **MIDI 2.0:**  
  - Moves from byte-oriented to 32-bit packet-based protocol.
  - Allows 16-bit and 32-bit high-res values for velocity, CC, pitch, and more.
  - Adds “Profiles” for device capability discovery (e.g., Drawbar Organ, Analog Synth).
  - “Property Exchange”: Structured data exchange for patch names, icons, device info.
  - Backwards compatible: Devices negotiate 1.0/2.0 via Capability Inquiry.

- **Packet Structure:**  
  - Universal MIDI Packet (UMP): Four 32-bit words per message; supports grouping, high-res, and new message types.
  - Flexible for future extensions; supports current and new controller types.

### 1.2 MIDI CI (Capability Inquiry) and Backwards Compatibility

- **MIDI-CI:**  
  - Devices exchange SysEx-based queries to determine supported features (MIDI 2.0, MPE, Profiles).
  - Negotiates best common mode (legacy 1.0 or full 2.0).
- **Practicalities:**  
  - Many controllers and synths will support both for years.
  - Important to test fallback and gracefully degrade features.

### 1.3 MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression): Channel Assignments and Use Cases

- **MPE Spec:**  
  - Each voice/note gets its own MIDI channel for per-note pitch bend, aftertouch, CCs.
  - Two zones: Lower (ch. 2–16 for notes, ch. 1 for global), Upper (ch. 1–15 for notes, ch. 16 for global).
- **Use Cases:**  
  - Expressive keyboards (Roli, Haken, LinnStrument).
  - Modular and DAW integration for per-note control.

### 1.4 MIDI 2.0 Per-Note Controllers and High-Resolution CCs

- **Per-Note Controllers:**  
  - Each note/voice can have its own parameter set (pitch, filter, envelope, etc.).
- **High-Resolution CCs:**  
  - 16/32-bit range for smooth, artifact-free automation.
- **Transition:**  
  - Engines must support both classic and high-res mapping, often in parallel.

### 1.5 Practical Integration: Synths, Controllers, DAWs

- **Synth/engine:**  
  - Map per-note data to voices, envelopes, mod slots.
  - Support both global and per-note automation.
- **Controller:**  
  - Multi-touch, slide, pressure, and other expressive data.
- **DAW:**  
  - MPE-aware piano rolls, per-note automation lanes, backward compatibility for old MIDI files.

### 1.6 Implementation Challenges and Solutions

- **Buffering:**  
  - Higher data rates require larger and smarter buffers.
- **Timing:**  
  - More granular timing and higher message rates stress real-time code.
- **Testing:**  
  - Use modern MIDI 2.0/MPE test suites and real-world devices.
- **Fallback:**  
  - Test all fallback paths; ensure no crashes or stuck notes on old gear.

## 2. OSC and Networked Control

### 2.1 OSC Protocol Overview: Messages, Bundles, Addressing

- **Open Sound Control (OSC):**  
  - UDP/IP-based; messages use string addresses (e.g., /synth/filter/cutoff).
  - Bundles: group multiple messages with timestamps.
- **Data Types:**  
  - Int, float, string, blob, arrays; supports high-res and arbitrary data.
- **Timetag:**  
  - Allows scheduling messages for future delivery (essential for distributed sync).

### 2.2 OSC vs. MIDI: When and Why to Use Each

- **OSC Strengths:**  
  - High resolution, flexible data, network-native, easy to extend.
  - Best for software, tablet, and modular app control.
- **MIDI Strengths:**  
  - Universally supported in hardware, deterministic timing.
- **Hybrid:**  
  - Many modern rigs use OSC for UI/control, MIDI for timing/notes.

### 2.3 Network Topologies: Peer-to-Peer, Broadcast, Multicast

- **Peer-to-peer:**  
  - Direct device-to-device; low latency.
- **Broadcast:**  
  - One device to all on network (UDP broadcast).
- **Multicast:**  
  - Efficient for multiple listeners, but may need router support.

### 2.4 Integration with DAWs, Tablets, and Modular Apps

- **DAWs:**  
  - Ableton Live, Logic, Bitwig: support OSC for remote and scripting control.
- **Tablets:**  
  - TouchOSC, Lemur, Open Stage Control: highly customizable UIs.
- **Modular Apps:**  
  - VCV Rack, Max/MSP, SuperCollider: deep OSC integration.

### 2.5 Synchronization, Latency, and Packet Loss

- **Latency:**  
  - Typically 1–10ms on local network, but can spike with congestion.
- **Jitter:**  
  - Use timetag and scheduling to smooth out.
- **Packet loss:**  
  - UDP is lossy; critical messages should be resent or confirmed.

### 2.6 Security and Firewall Considerations

- **OSC is open:**  
  - Anyone on network can send data; firewall and authentication are important on public networks.
- **Best practice:**  
  - Use dedicated network or VLAN for live control; avoid internet-exposed endpoints unless secured.

### 2.7 Practice: Simple OSC Control Surface

- Build a Python or JS script to send/receive OSC to a workstation.
- Implement a basic fader and button; map to engine parameter.

## 3. MIDI-CV and Hybrid Analog/Digital Control

### 3.1 CV/Gate Basics: Voltage Standards, Gate Types

- **CV (Control Voltage):**  
  - 1V/octave (Moog, Eurorack) or Hz/V (Korg, Yamaha); up to 10–12V swings.
- **Gate/Trigger:**  
  - Gate: sustained voltage for note duration; Trigger: short pulse.
- **Standards:**  
  - Check synth compatibility; some need positive, others negative gate.

### 3.2 MIDI-to-CV Conversion: Hardware and Software

- **Dedicated converters:**  
  - Kenton, Doepfer, Expert Sleepers, Mutable Instruments Yarns.

- **Software:**  
  - Audio interface + DC-coupled outputs for “CV audio”; e.g., Silent Way, CV Tools.

### 3.3 Polyphonic CV, Note Priority, and Voice Assignment

- **Mono vs. poly:**  
  - Mono: 1 CV/gate; Poly: multiple CV/gate pairs.
- **Voice assignment:**  
  - Round robin, lowest/highest note, retrigger modes.
- **Priority:**  
  - Last, high, low, or random.

### 3.4 Mapping MIDI, CC, and Automation to Analog Outputs

- **CV outputs:**  
  - Map notes to pitch CV, velocity to level CV, CCs to filter or modulation CV.
- **Automation:**  
  - Record/playback automation to CV for analog modulation.
- **Calibration:**  
  - Account for voltage scaling, offset, and drift.

### 3.5 Clock, Sync, and Din-Sync Integration

- **Clock output:**  
  - Square wave or pulse per quarter note (PPQN: 24, 48, 96, etc.).
- **Din-Sync:**  
  - Roland/Sync24; 5-pin DIN, 24 pulses per quarter, separate run/stop line.
- **Start/stop:**  
  - Sync signal for modular and drum machines.

### 3.6 Sample Code: MIDI-to-CV Engine

- Write a microcontroller sketch to convert MIDI note/CC to CV/gate with calibration and offset parameters.

  - Typical latency: 7–20ms; can spike with interference.
  - Pairing: Standard OS dialogs, may need “MIDI connect” app on some platforms.
- **Throughput:**  
  - Lower than wired USB; not suitable for large SysEx or dense polyphony.

### 4.2 WiFi MIDI: RTP-MIDI, AppleMIDI, and Networked Sessions

- **RTP-MIDI/AppleMIDI:**  
  - Used for network MIDI over WiFi/Ethernet; built-in on macOS, iOS, and many DAWs.

- **Latency:**  
  - 2–10ms in good conditions; can rise with network load.
- **Use cases:**  
  - Multiple devices across studio, remote performance, tablet/phone controllers.

### 4.3 Hybrid Protocols: MIDI over Zigbee, LoRa, or Custom RF

- **Zigbee, LoRa:**  
  - Experimental for long-range, low-bandwidth MIDI control (e.g., stage lighting, remote triggers).
- **Custom RF:**  
  - Proprietary wireless MIDI for special applications (wearables, art installations).

### 4.4 Use Cases: Mobile Controllers, Remote Setups, Live Performance

- **Mobile:**  
  - Wireless pads/keys for performance, walk-around control.

### 5.4 Error Handling and Safety in Scripting Engines

- **Sandboxing:**  
  - Limit script access to prevent crashes or security issues.
- **Timeouts:**  
  - Abort scripts that run too long or loop.

### 6.5 Real-World Case Studies: Solving Complex Control Bugs

- **Case 1:**  
  - Stuck notes on long SysEx dump — solution: buffer incoming SysEx, throttle output.
- **Case 2:**  
  - Wireless MIDI drops during live set — solution: monitor RF spectrum, switch to wired backup.
- **Case 3:**
