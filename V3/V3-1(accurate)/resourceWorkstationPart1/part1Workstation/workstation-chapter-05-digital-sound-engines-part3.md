## 1. Introduction: Why Effects, Mixing, and Modulation Matter

No modern workstation is complete without:
- **Effects:** Delay, reverb, chorus, etc. add depth, space, and interest to raw sounds.
- **Mixing:** Combining multiple voices, channels, and layers into a single stereo (or multichannel) output.
- **Modulation:** Dynamic control of parameters (LFO, envelope, velocity, aftertouch, etc.) is key to expressiveness.

**A professional engine is more than just oscillators and samples.**  
The “glue” is how you process, combine, and modulate all those voices and effects in real time.

## 2. Digital Effects Basics

### 2.1 Categories of Effects

- **Delay:** Echoes, slapback, simple or multi-tap
- **Reverb:** Simulates spaces; from simple plate/room to full impulse responses
- **Chorus/Flanger:** Modulated delay/feedback for “thickening”
- **Distortion/Overdrive:** Non-linear waveshaping for harmonics
- **EQ/Filtering:** Tone shaping, band emphasis/suppression
- **Compressor/Limiter:** Dynamic range control

### 2.2 Signal Flow and Insert/Send Effects

- **Insert:** Effect is in the main path (e.g., distortion on a guitar)
- **Send:** Effect is on a separate path, mixed in with dry signal (e.g., reverb return)

**Example:**
```
Voice Out --[Insert: Chorus]--[Insert: Delay]--[Insert: EQ]---> Main Mix
                                   |
                                   +--[Send: Reverb]-->+
```

### 2.3 Effect Parameterization and Presets

- Effects have parameters (delay time, feedback, wet/dry, etc.)
- Presets = named collections of parameters
- Store in a struct, load/save as needed

**Example:**
```c
typedef struct {
    float delay_time;   // ms
    float feedback;     // 0..1
    float wet;          // 0..1
    float dry;          // 0..1
} DelayParams;
```

### 2.4 Practice: Implementing a Delay Effect in C

**Delay Line Structure:**
```c
#define DELAY_BUF_SIZE 48000 // 1 sec @ 48kHz
typedef struct {
    float buf[DELAY_BUF_SIZE];
    int write_pos;
    int delay_samples;
    float feedback;
    float wet, dry;
} Delay;

void delay_init(Delay *d, int delay_ms, float feedback, float wet, float dry, int sample_rate) {
    d->delay_samples = (delay_ms * sample_rate) / 1000;
    d->write_pos = 0;
    d->feedback = feedback;
    d->wet = wet;
    d->dry = dry;
    memset(d->buf, 0, sizeof(d->buf));
}

float delay_process(Delay *d, float in) {
    int read_pos = (d->write_pos - d->delay_samples + DELAY_BUF_SIZE) % DELAY_BUF_SIZE;
    float delayed = d->buf[read_pos];
    float out = d->dry * in + d->wet * delayed;
    d->buf[d->write_pos] = in + delayed * d->feedback;
    d->write_pos = (d->write_pos + 1) % DELAY_BUF_SIZE;
    return out;
}
```

## 3. Digital Mixing

### 3.1 Summing, Panning, and Level Control

- **Summing:** Add all active voices/tracks, apply normalization to prevent clipping.
- **Panning:** Adjust left/right balance per voice or track.
- **Level Control:** Each channel has a volume fader (scalar multiplier).

**Example:**
```c
typedef struct {
    float pan;   // 0=Left, 0.5=Center, 1=Right
    float level; // 0..1
} Channel;

void mix_stereo(float *outL, float *outR, float in, Channel *ch) {
    float l = cosf(ch->pan * 0.5f * M_PI);   // Equal power panning
    float r = sinf(ch->pan * 0.5f * M_PI);
    *outL += in * l * ch->level;
    *outR += in * r * ch->level;
}
```

### 3.2 Bus Architecture: Sends, Groups, FX Buses

- **Buses:** Logical channels for grouping (Drums, Synths, FX, etc.)
- **FX Sends:** Route signal to effects, then back to main or submix.
- **Submixes:** Combine groups before final output.

**Example Bus Structure:**
```c
typedef struct {
    float *inputs;
    int num_inputs;
    float gain;
} Bus;
```

### 3.3 Metering and Headroom

- **Metering:** Show levels to user (peak, RMS, VU).
- **Headroom:** Leave space below digital maximum (0 dBFS) to avoid clipping.

**Simple peak meter:**
```c
typedef struct {
    float peak;
} Meter;

void meter_update(Meter *m, float sample) {
    float abs = fabsf(sample);
    if (abs > m->peak) m->peak = abs;
}
```

### 3.4 Practice: Building a Digital Mixer Structure

- Implement an array of channels, each with pan/level
- Sum and pan all channels to stereo out
- Add a send bus for global reverb

## 4. Layering and Voice Management

### 4.1 Layered Sounds: Velocity, Key, and Zone Splits

- **Layered Sounds:** Multiple voices (samples, synths) triggered by one note, with splits by key, velocity, or controller.
- **Example:** A piano sound with a bright layer for hard velocities, and a synth pad above middle C.

### 4.2 Voice Allocation Strategies

- **Fixed Voice Pool:** Pre-allocate all voices (no malloc in real time).
- **Per-Layer Allocation:** Each layer has its own pool/queue.

### 4.3 Voice Stealing Algorithms

- When all voices are busy, choose one to “steal” (end early for new note).
- **Strategies:** Oldest, quietest, lowest priority.

**Example:**
```c
int find_voice_to_steal(Voice voices[], int n) {
    int min_idx = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (voices[i].age > voices[min_idx].age) min_idx = i;
    }
    return min_idx;
}
```

### 4.4 Practice: Implementing a Layered Patch Engine

- Create a patch structure with multiple layers
- For each incoming note, trigger all active layers’ voices
- Manage polyphony and voice stealing per layer

## 5. Modulation Matrix

### 5.1 What is a Modulation Matrix?

- **Modulation Matrix:** Flexible routing of sources (LFOs, envelopes, velocity, aftertouch) to destinations (pitch, filter, amp, FX).
- Classic in Oberheim Xpander, Matrix-12, many modern VSTs.

### 5.2 Mod Sources and Destinations

- **Sources:** LFOs, envelopes, note velocity, key position, aftertouch, mod wheel, external CV, random, etc.
- **Destinations:** Oscillator pitch, filter cutoff, amp gain, FX parameters, pan, etc.

### 5.3 Data Structures for Routing

```c
#define NUM_MOD_SLOTS 16

typedef enum { MOD_SRC_LFO1, MOD_SRC_ENV1, MOD_SRC_VEL, ... } ModSource;
typedef enum { MOD_DEST_PITCH, MOD_DEST_CUTOFF, MOD_DEST_AMP, ... } ModDest;

typedef struct {
    ModSource src;
    ModDest dest;
    float amount; // -1..1
} ModSlot;

typedef struct {
    ModSlot slots[NUM_MOD_SLOTS];
    int num_slots;
} ModMatrix;
```

### 5.4 Real-Time Evaluation and Smoothing

- Each audio frame, sum all active mod routes for each destination
- Use smoothing (low-pass filter) for “zipper noise” on fast parameter changes

**Example:**
```c
float get_mod_value(ModMatrix *mm, ModDest dest, ModContext *ctx) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int i = 0; i < mm->num_slots; ++i) {
        if (mm->slots[i].dest == dest)
            sum += get_source_value(ctx, mm->slots[i].src) * mm->slots[i].amount;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### 5.5 Practice: Simple Modulation Matrix in C

- Implement a matrix with at least 4 sources and 4 destinations
- Allow user to set amount and routing at runtime
- Evaluate and apply all modulations per frame

---

## 6. Real-World Digital Audio Engine Design

### 6.1 Engine Architectures: Monolithic vs. Modular

- **Monolithic:** All engine code in one big structure. Simple for small projects, but hard to scale.
- **Modular:** Separate modules for voices, FX, mixer, etc. Communicate via buffers and APIs. Scales to workstation-class engines.

### 6.2 Buffering, Scheduling, and Real-Time Constraints

- Work in blocks/frames (e.g., 64/128/256 samples per buffer) for efficiency
- Always process audio in a tight, deterministic loop—no malloc, printf, or blocking calls!
- Split work into real-time (audio thread) and non-realtime (UI, file loading) contexts

### 6.3 CPU Optimization and SIMD

- Use SIMD (NEON, SSE) for vectorized DSP (filters, mixing, FX)
- Profile and optimize inner loops (voice mixing, FX processing)
- Avoid cache misses and memory fragmentation

### 6.4 Debugging and Profiling Audio Engines

- Add CPU usage meters, buffer overrun detection, and voice/Fx counters
- Use logging for non-realtime events (never in the audio callback!)
- Test with max polyphony, all FX on, worst-case scenarios

### 6.5 Practice: Profiling and Optimizing a Synth Engine

- Measure buffer processing time (in samples, ms, % CPU)
- Identify and optimize bottlenecks (e.g., slow FX, long modulation chains)
- Try replacing inner loops with manual unrolling or SIMD

6. **Real-Time Audio Thread**
    - Write a real-time-safe audio processing loop: no malloc/free, no blocking, handle buffer underrun.

7. **Profiling**
    - Instrument your engine to measure buffer processing time, max CPU usage, and polyphony limit.

8. **Signal Flow Diagram**
    - Draw a block diagram showing voices, FX, mixer, modulation, and output.

9. **Parameter Smoothing**
    - Implement a one-pole low-pass filter to smooth any parameter that is modulated (e.g., cutoff, pitch).

10. **Documentation**
    - Write detailed comments and a README for your digital engine, describing modules, signal flow, and usage.
