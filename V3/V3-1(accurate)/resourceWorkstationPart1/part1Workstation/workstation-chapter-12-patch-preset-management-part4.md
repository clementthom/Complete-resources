## 1. Deep Automation and Workflow Scripting

### 1.1 Scriptable Patch Actions: Conditions, Triggers, and Scheduling

- **Conditional triggers:**  
  - Execute actions based on state (e.g., “if filter cutoff > 80% and sequencer at bar 17, morph to patch B”).
  - Time-based triggers (schedule patch changes at exact bars/timecodes).
  - User events: assign macros to physical gestures, footswitches, MIDI events, or sensor data (accelerometer, force, touch).

- **Scripting environments:**  
  - Support for embedded scripting languages (Lua, JS, Python), including event listeners, timers, and state machines.
  - Sandboxed execution for safety and reliability.

### 1.2 Event-Driven Patch Logic: MIDI, CV, UI, and Sensor Inputs

- **MIDI events:**  
  - Respond to program changes, CCs, notes, aftertouch, or custom SysEx.
  - Conditional logic: e.g., “on CC64 (sustain pedal) and velocity > 100, recall ‘Fortissimo’ patch.”

- **CV/gate and analog triggers:**  
  - Analog voltage or gate triggers can select patches or morph parameters.
  - Useful for modular integration and experimental/alternative controllers.

- **UI and sensor integration:**  
  - Touch, accelerometer, pressure, or custom sensors trigger patch recalls or automation routines.

### 1.3 Automation Templates, Preset Macros, and Batch Routines

- **Templates:**  
  - Prebuilt automation routines for common scenarios (e.g., auto-morph on scene change, setlist advance on cue).
- **Preset macros:**  
  - Batch parameter changes, multi-patch edits, or chained recalls.
- **Batch routines:**  
  - Schedule or trigger batch exports, backups, mass tagging, or migration.

### 1.4 Integration with Sequencers, Scenes, and Arrangements

- **Timeline automation:**  
  - Trigger patch changes, morphs, or FX recalls at specific timeline positions.
- **Scene-based recall:**  
  - Tie patch changes to DAW or internal scenes; recall complex setups in a single action.
- **Arrangement integration:**  
  - Map patches to song sections, support “arrangement view” for patch management.

### 1.5 Practice: Advanced Automation Routines and Script Libraries

- Implement a script that cycles through a set of patches on each bar.
- Write a batch export script triggered by a specific MIDI CC.
- Build an automation routine that saves a versioned backup every hour.

  - Record origin of patch (factory, user, vendor, imported, AI-generated).
- **Provenance:**  
  - Document all edits, merges, and ownership transfers.
- **Copyright and usage rights:**  
  - Track license, creator, allowed uses (commercial, educational, personal), expiry, and shareability.

### 2.2 Patch Provenance Tracking and Chain of Edits

- **Edit chain:**  
  - History of all edits, forks, merges, and ownership changes.
