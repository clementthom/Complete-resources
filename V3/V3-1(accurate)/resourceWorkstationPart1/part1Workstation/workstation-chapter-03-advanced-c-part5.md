## 1. Introduction: Why Build Systems and Compilation Matter

As your workstation project grows, you'll quickly move from single-file programs to hundreds of source and header files.  
**A robust build system:**
- Ensures all files are compiled and linked in the right order
- Automates repetitive commands (clean, rebuild, test)
- Reduces mistakes ("it compiles on my machine...")
- Enables cross-platform development and team collaboration

**Key Principle:**  
A successful embedded/music project is only as strong as its ability to build, run, and evolve reliably.

## 2. The C Build Process: From Source to Executable

### 2.1 Steps in Building a C Project

1. **Preprocessing:**  
   Handles `#include`, `#define`, conditional compilation (`#ifdef`).

2. **Compiling:**  
   Each `.c` file is compiled into an object file (`.o`) with machine code.

3. **Assembling:**  
   Converts assembly code to machine code (handled by compiler).

4. **Linking:**  
   Combines all object files and libraries into the final executable.

### 2.2 Visualizing the Build

| Step        | Input           | Output           | Command Example                   |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Preprocess  | `main.c`        | expanded code    | `gcc -E main.c`                   |
| Compile     | `main.c`        | `main.o`         | `gcc -c main.c`                   |
| Link        | `main.o`, libs  | `synth`          | `gcc main.o -o synth`             |

---

## 3. Compiling Single-File Programs: The Basics

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o synth main.c
./synth
```
- `-Wall -Wextra`: Enable all warnings (best practice)
- `-o synth`: Name the output file

---

## 4. Multi-File Projects: Compilation Units, Object Files, and Linking

### 4.1 Splitting Code for Modularity

As your codebase grows, split it into logical modules:
- `main.c`: Entry point
- `oscillator.c/.h`: Oscillator module
- `envelope.c/.h`: Envelope module
- `filter.c/.h`: Filter module

### 4.2 Compiling Each File

Compile each `.c` file into an object file:
```bash
gcc -c oscillator.c -o oscillator.o
gcc -c envelope.c -o envelope.o
gcc -c main.c -o main.o
```

### 4.3 Linking Object Files

Link all object files to create the executable:
```bash
gcc main.o oscillator.o envelope.o -o synth
```

---

## 5. Makefiles: Automating Builds for Workstation-Scale Projects

### 5.1 What Is a Makefile?

- A script for the `make` build automation tool
- Defines rules for compiling and linking files
- Tracks dependencies: only rebuilds what has changed

### 5.2 Simple Makefile Example

```makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -g
SRC = main.c oscillator.c envelope.c
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)
TARGET = synth

all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(OBJ)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

clean:
	rm -f $(OBJ) $(TARGET)
```

### 5.3 How to Use

- `make` — builds the project
- `make clean` — removes object files and executable

### 5.4 Makefile Best Practices

- Use variables for compiler, flags, sources
- Modularize Makefiles for large projects (include subdirectories)
- Document special targets (test, install, docs)

---

## 6. Organizing Your Project Directory for Growth

### 6.1 Example Directory Structure

```
workstation-project/
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── src/
│   ├── main.c
│   ├── oscillator.c
│   ├── envelope.c
│   └── ...
├── include/
│   ├── oscillator.h
│   ├── envelope.h
│   └── ...
├── tests/
│   └── test_oscillator.c
├── build/
│   └── (object files, binaries)
├── docs/
│   └── architecture.md
├── hardware/
│   └── (KiCAD, PCB files)
```

### 6.2 Why This Matters

- Separation of source, headers, tests, docs, hardware
- Easy for collaborators to find what they need
- Scales to hundreds of files

---

## 7. Header Dependencies, Forward Declarations, and Best Practices

### 7.1 Avoiding Circular Dependencies

- Only include what you need in each header
- Use forward declarations (`struct Foo;`) when possible

**Example:**
```c
// envelope.h
#ifndef ENVELOPE_H
#define ENVELOPE_H
typedef struct Envelope Envelope;
Envelope *envelope_create(void);
void envelope_destroy(Envelope *);
#endif
```
```c
// oscillator.h
#ifndef OSCILLATOR_H
#define OSCILLATOR_H
#include "envelope.h" // Only if needed!
typedef struct Oscillator Oscillator;
#endif
```

### 7.2 Include Guards

- Prevent multiple inclusion (`#ifndef ... #define ... #endif`)

### 7.3 Minimizing Includes in Headers

- Prefer including headers in `.c` files whenever possible
- Only expose necessary types and functions

---

## 8. Static and Dynamic Libraries: Sharing Code Across Projects

### 8.1 Static Libraries (`.a` files)

- Archive of object files, linked into executable at build time

```bash
ar rcs libaudio.a oscillator.o envelope.o
gcc main.o -L. -laudio -o synth
```

### 8.2 Dynamic Libraries (`.so` files)

- Shared at runtime, can be updated independently

```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -o libaudio.so oscillator.o envelope.o
gcc main.o -L. -laudio -o synth
```

### 8.3 When to Use?

- Static: for small, embedded, or performance-critical code
- Dynamic: when distributing updates separately or supporting plugins

---

## 9. Compiler Flags: Optimization, Debugging, and Warnings

### 9.1 Debugging

- `-g`: Include debug information for GDB

### 9.2 Optimization

- `-O0`: No optimization (debugging)
- `-O2`/`-O3`: Optimize for speed (use for release builds)

### 9.3 Warnings

- `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`: Enable all warnings, treat as errors (forces you to fix all warnings)

### 9.4 Platform Targeting

- `-march=armv8-a` for Raspberry Pi 4
- `-mfpu=neon` for ARM NEON SIMD instructions

---

## 10. Cross-Compilation: Building for Raspberry Pi from Linux PC

### 10.1 Why Cross-Compile?

- Your PC may be x86_64, Pi is ARM
- Build on fast machine, run on target hardware

### 10.2 Toolchains

- Install cross-compiler (e.g., `arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc`)
- Set `CC` in Makefile to cross-compiler

### 10.3 Example

```makefile
CC = arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc
CFLAGS = -O2 -march=armv8-a
```

- Use `scp` or similar to copy executable to Pi

---

## 11. Integrating Third-Party Libraries (PortAudio Example)

### 11.1 Why Use Libraries?

- Don’t reinvent the wheel! Use tested code for audio I/O, MIDI, file formats, etc.

### 11.2 Installing PortAudio

- On Linux: `sudo apt-get install libportaudio2 libportaudio-dev`

### 11.3 Linking with PortAudio

- Add `-lportaudio` to linker flags

```bash
gcc main.o audio.o -lportaudio -o synth
```

### 11.4 Including PortAudio Headers

```c
#include <portaudio.h>
```

### 11.5 Makefile Integration

```makefile
LIBS = -lportaudio
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJ) $(LIBS) -o $(TARGET)
```

---

## 12. Continuous Integration: Automated Builds and Tests

### 12.1 What Is CI?

- System that automatically builds/tests your code on every commit/push
- Ensures code always compiles, tests always pass

### 12.2 GitHub Actions Example

- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: Build and Test

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Install build tools
      run: sudo apt-get install build-essential libportaudio-dev
    - name: Build
      run: make
    - name: Run tests
      run: make test
```

---

## 13. Practice Section 5: Building and Managing a Large C Project

### 13.1 Create a Multi-Module Project

- Split your code into at least 3 modules (oscillator, envelope, main)
- Write headers and sources, include guards, and a Makefile

### 13.2 Add PortAudio for Audio Output

- Implement a basic sine wave generator and play through PortAudio

### 13.3 Set Up Automated Testing

- Write a test for each module
- Add a `make test` target to your Makefile

### 13.4 Use GitHub Actions for CI

- Push your repo to GitHub with `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Check that all builds and tests pass automatically
