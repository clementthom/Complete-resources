- **Audio/MIDI over network:**  
  - Replace cables with Ethernet/WiFi; enables distributed stage/studio.
- **Firmware/patch updates:**  
  - Seamless delivery and maintenance over the network/cloud.
- **Live streaming and monitoring:**  
  - Broadcast, remote FOH, or recording via networked endpoints.

### 1.2 Key Use Cases for Audio/MIDI Networking

- **Live performance:**  
  - Multi-instrument, multi-location sync; distributed mixing and monitoring.
- **Studio:**  
  - Patch/project sync, remote sound design, DAW-integrated control.
- **Installations:**

## 2. MIDI 2.0, RTP-MIDI, and Networked MIDI Protocols

### 2.1 MIDI 1.0 vs. MIDI 2.0: Data, Timing, and Expansion

- **MIDI 1.0:**  
  - Serial, unidirectional, 31.25kbps, 7-bit data, limited channel/timing resolution.
- **MIDI 2.0:**  
  - Bidirectional, high-res (32-bit), per-note control, richer meta, profiles, property exchange.
- **Timing:**  
  - MIDI 2.0 native timestamping, higher data rates, but requires new hardware/firmware.
- **Backward compatibility:**  
  - MIDI-CI (Capability Inquiry) allows devices to negotiate 1.0/2.0 mode.

### 2.2 RTP-MIDI and AppleMIDI: Protocol, Synchronization, and Packetization

- **RTP-MIDI:**  
  - MIDI over UDP/IP; low-latency, clock sync, session management.
  - Bundles multiple MIDI messages per packet, with timestamps.
- **AppleMIDI:**  
  - Apple's implementation, but widely adopted; session discovery, peer-to-peer.
- **Session management:**  
  - Devices negotiate sessions, ports, and clock; auto-reconnect and failover.
- **Use cases:**  
  - Multi-device jam, tablet control, wireless DAW integration.

### 2.3 USB, Bluetooth, and WiFi MIDI: Stack Internals and Latency Considerations

- **USB MIDI:**  
  - High bandwidth, low latency (<1ms), hot-plug, host/device roles.
  - Class drivers standard; most embedded MCUs provide at least device mode.
- **Bluetooth MIDI:**  
  - BLE MIDI for portable/wireless, but with higher latency (10-15ms typical).
  - Pairing, reconnection, and throughput bottlenecks.
- **WiFi MIDI:**  
  - Leverages RTP-MIDI; more robust than BLE, but network jitter/roaming must be managed.

### 2.4 Multi-Client, Multi-Session, and Clock Distribution

- **Multi-client:**  
  - Multiple apps/devices can connect to same MIDI stream.
- **Session management:**  
  - Handle disconnects, clock sync, and per-session buffering.

  - Used by Dante, AVB, AES67.
- **Word clock:**  
  - Traditional hardware sync; can be distributed over network or as auxiliary.
- **Sample-accurate streaming:**  
  - All nodes use same master clock; packets contain sample counters and timestamps for alignment.

### 3.3 Buffering, Jitter, and Dropout Mitigation

- **Jitter buffers:**  
  - Absorb network delay variations; trade latency for reliability.
- **Headroom:**  
  - Extra samples buffered to handle spikes in network delay.

  - Fill with zeros, repeat last buffer, or interpolate; log and notify user.

### 3.4 Multicast, Unicast, and Routing in Embedded Networks

- **Multicast:**  
  - Send one packet to many receivers; efficient for broadcast, but needs switch support.
- **Unicast:**  
  - One-to-one; simpler, but scales poorly to many receivers.
- **Routing:**  
  - Embedded devices must manage IGMP/MLD joins, ARP/NDP, and routing tables if acting as routers.
