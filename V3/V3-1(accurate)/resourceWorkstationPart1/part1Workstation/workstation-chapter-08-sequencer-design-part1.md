## 1. Introduction: Why Sequencers Matter in Workstations

Sequencers are the "brain" of a music workstation — they turn a collection of sounds into a song, a live act, or a complex multi-part arrangement.  
A sequencer enables you to:
- Compose and edit music non-linearly
- Program rhythms, basslines, melodies, and automation
- Record and playback performances in perfect sync
- Layer and arrange sounds across time, keys, and velocities

**Classic Workstations:**  
- Roland MC series, Yamaha QY, Akai MPC, Korg Triton, and countless grooveboxes all rely on powerful sequencers for their workflow.

**In modern systems**, sequencers are deeply integrated with sound engines, UI, MIDI, and even external DAWs or modular gear.

## 2. Sequencer Fundamentals

### 2.1 What is a Sequencer?

A **sequencer** is a device or software module that records, stores, and plays back timed musical events (notes, controllers, automation, etc.).
- At its core, it’s a timeline of events: “Play C4 at 0ms, D#4 at 500ms, mod wheel up at 1000ms...”
- Sequencers can be simple (step, drum grid) or complex (multi-track, arranger, pattern chainers).

### 2.2 Types of Sequencers

- **Step Sequencer:**  
  - User enters notes into a fixed grid (steps), typically 8, 16, or 32 steps per bar.
  - Examples: Roland TR-808/909, Arturia BeatStep, Elektron Analog Four.

- **Real-Time Sequencer:**  
  - Records user input live, with variable timing, velocity, and controllers.
  - Quantization may be applied to "snap" notes to the grid.
  - Examples: Akai MPC, DAW piano rolls.

- **Hybrid Sequencer:**  
  - Combines step and real-time features.
  - Edit steps, overdub live, manipulate automation, swing, or microtiming.

### 2.3 Historical Sequencer Designs

- **Analog Step Sequencers:**  
  - Moog 960, ARP 1601: voltage-based, simple steps, no memory.
- **Digital Step Sequencers:**  
  - Roland MC-4, Yamaha QX1: basic pattern memory, more steps, tighter timing.
- **Modern Workstations:**  
  - Multi-track, hierarchical song/pattern/scene, real-time and step, with full automation and MIDI/CC support.

## 3. Step Sequencers: Concepts and Structure

### 3.1 Basic Step Sequencer Model

- **Grid:** Rows (tracks/channels) x columns (steps), e.g., 8 tracks × 16 steps.
- Each cell holds note data: pitch, velocity, gate length, tie, accent, controller, etc.

**Visual Example:**
```
Track 1: | X |   | X |   | X |   | X |   | ...
Track 2: |   | X |   | X |   | X |   | X | ...
```
(X = note on)

### 3.2 Grid/Pattern Concepts

- **Pattern:** Single set of steps (e.g., 16-step drum pattern).
- **Chain:** Sequence of patterns to form a song.
- **Page:** Some sequencers allow >16 steps by chaining pages.

### 3.3 Step Data

Each step can store:
- **Note:** MIDI note number (0–127)
- **Velocity:** 0–127 (how hard)
- **Gate:** Step length (duration, percent)
- **Tie:** Extend note over multiple steps
- **Accent:** Higher velocity or special articulation
- **Controller:** CC value, aftertouch, etc.
- **Probability/Randomization:** Chance to trigger

**C Struct Example:**
```c
typedef struct {
    uint8_t note;
    uint8_t velocity;
    uint8_t gate;
    uint8_t accent;
    uint8_t cc_value;
    uint8_t tie;
    uint8_t prob;
} Step;
```

### 3.4 Step Resolution and Swing

- **Resolution:** Steps per quarter note (PPQN), e.g., 16 steps = sixteenth notes.
- **Swing:** Offsets even steps to create groove.

### 3.5 Basic Step Sequencer Algorithms

- For each clock tick:
    1. Advance step pointer (modulo pattern length)
    2. For each track, check if step is active
    3. Output note on/off, set gate, velocity, controller values
    4. Handle ties, accents, and swing

## 4. Real-Time Sequencers: Concepts and Structure

### 4.1 What is Real-Time Recording?

- User plays notes live; sequencer records timing, duration, velocity, CCs, and automation.
- Can overdub (add more notes/automation on top of existing pattern).
- Quantization can be applied during or after recording.

### 4.2 Handling Timing, Quantization, and Overdubbing

- **Timing:** Measure time between events (use internal clock or MIDI clock).
- **Quantization:** Move recorded notes to nearest grid point (optional).
- **Overdubbing:** Allow for new events to be layered on top without erasing existing data.
- **Erase/Undo:** Enable removal or undoing of mistakes.

### 4.3 Capturing Controller and Automation Data

- Record pitch bend, mod wheel, aftertouch, CCs, and custom automation lanes.
- Store as event streams (timestamped) or per-step values (for step automation).

### 4.4 Managing Polyphony and Multi-Track Recording

- Support for chords, overlapping notes, and multi-part recording.
- Tracks can be assigned to different sound engines, channels, or parts.

## 5. Sequencer Data Structures

### 5.1 Notes, Steps, Patterns, Songs

- **Note Event:** Timestamp, pitch, velocity, duration, channel.
- **Step:** Encodes note(s) and parameters for fixed grid.
- **Pattern:** Array of steps and meta info (length, swing, etc.).
- **Song:** List of patterns, arrangement, global automation.

### 5.2 Track, Channel, and Part Abstractions

- **Track:** A single instrument or MIDI channel’s sequence (drums, bass, lead).
- **Channel:** MIDI channel or internal voice assignment.
- **Part:** Logical grouping — may span multiple tracks, used for layering or splits.

### 5.3 Meta Events, Automation, and Markers

- **Meta Events:** Tempo changes, scene changes, repeats, etc.
- **Automation:** Parameter changes over time (filter, FX, etc.).
- **Markers:** Start, stop, loop points, cue locations.

### 5.4 Memory Management for Long Sequences

- Use ring buffers or linked lists for real-time event handling.
- Allow dynamic allocation for variable-length songs.
- Compress patterns (run-length encoding or delta time) for RAM efficiency.

## 6. Timebases and Clocks

### 6.1 PPQN, Ticks, Bars/Beats, and Measures

- **PPQN:** Pulses Per Quarter Note (24, 48, 96, 192+), defines sequencer resolution.
- **Ticks:** Smallest time division, used for event scheduling.
- **Bars/Beats:** Musical structure—groups of measures, beats per bar.
- **Time Signature:** 4/4, 3/4, 7/8, etc.

### 6.2 Internal vs. External Clocks

- **Internal Clock:** Sequencer generates its own timing.
- **External Clock:** Receives timing from MIDI Clock, DIN Sync, or analog pulse.
- Allows syncing to DAW, drum machine, modular, or other workstation.

### 6.3 Synchronization, Start/Stop, and Song Position Pointer

- **Start/Stop:** Can be triggered by UI, MIDI, or external clock.
- **Song Position Pointer (SPP):** MIDI message to jump to a measure/beat.
- Must handle tempo changes and keep all tracks synchronized.

## 7. Practice Section 1: Step and Real-Time Sequencer Prototypes

### 7.1 Step Sequencer Grid

- Implement a 16-step, 4-track grid in C or Python.
- Allow editing of note, velocity, gate, tie, and accent per step.
- Add simple playback: advance steps, output note-on/off events.

### 7.2 Real-Time Recording

- Capture live key input (simulate or MIDI).
- Record timestamp, note, velocity, duration.
- Implement quantization and overdubbing.

### 7.3 Pattern Chaining

- Allow user to chain patterns into a longer sequence (song mode).
- Provide UI or CLI to arrange, repeat, and jump between patterns.

### 7.4 Automation Lane

- Record and playback controller (e.g., filter cutoff) changes.
- Allow lane editing (draw, erase, scale values).
