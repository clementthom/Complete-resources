## 1. Introduction: Why Pointers Matter

Pointers are the most powerful—and most misunderstood—feature of C.  
They let you:
- Work directly with memory and hardware registers
- Create dynamic data structures (linked lists, trees, buffers)
- Pass large data efficiently to functions
- Build modular, reusable code (e.g., callback functions)

But they also introduce complexity and new dangers: uninitialized pointers, memory leaks, buffer overflows, and “undefined behavior.”

**Mastering pointers is absolutely essential for embedded audio, workstation firmware, and any serious C project.**

## 2. Understanding Addresses and Memory Layout

### 2.1 What Is an Address?

- Every variable in C is stored somewhere in the computer’s memory.
- The **address** is the “location” in RAM where the variable lives.

**Example:**
```c
int x = 123;
printf("Address of x: %p\n", (void*)&x);
```
- `%p` prints the address as a hexadecimal number (e.g., `0x7ffee8a3c8b4`).

### 2.2 Memory Layout (Stack, Heap, Data Segment)

- **Stack:** Holds local variables, function call frames. Fast, but limited in size.
- **Heap:** Dynamically allocated memory (via `malloc`/`free`). Managed by you.
- **Data segment:** Global/static variables.
- **Code segment:** The program’s actual instructions.

> **Embedded and audio programming often require you to optimize memory usage and layout for performance and safety.**

## 3. Pointers: Declaration, Initialization, and Usage

### 3.1 Declaring and Using Pointers

```c
int a = 7;
int *p = &a; // p is a pointer to int, storing address of a
printf("Value at p: %d\n", *p); // Dereference p to get value at that address
```
- `*p` means “the value pointed to by p”

### 3.2 Null and Uninitialized Pointers

- A **null pointer** points to nothing: `int *q = NULL;`
- **Uninitialized pointers** are dangerous—always set to NULL or a valid address before use.

### 3.3 Pointer Types

- `int *`, `float *`, `char *`, `struct MyStruct *`
- Type safety: don’t mix pointer types without explicit casting.

### 3.4 Pointers to Pointers

- Sometimes you need a pointer to a pointer: `int **pp;`
- Used for dynamic arrays, passing arrays by reference, etc.

---

## 4. Arrays and Pointer Arithmetic

### 4.1 Declaring and Using Arrays

```c
float buffer[256]; // 256 floats
buffer[0] = 0.0f;
buffer[255] = 1.0f;
```

### 4.2 Pointers and Arrays

- The name of an array is a pointer to its first element: `buffer == &buffer[0]`

```c
float *p = buffer;
printf("%f\n", *(p+3)); // Same as buffer[3]
```

### 4.3 Pointer Arithmetic

- `p+1` moves to the next element (size depends on pointer type)
- Always stay within array bounds!

**Example: Iterating with pointers**
```c
for (float *p = buffer; p < buffer + 256; ++p) {
    *p = 0.5f; // Set all buffer elements to 0.5
}
```

### 4.4 Arrays of Pointers

- Useful for managing resources (e.g., `char *patchNames[128];`)

---

## 5. Multidimensional Arrays

### 5.1 Declaring and Accessing

```c
int grid[8][16]; // 8 rows, 16 columns
grid[2][5] = 42;
```

### 5.2 Passing to Functions

```c
void print_grid(int rows, int cols, int grid[rows][cols]) {
    for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++)
        for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++)
            printf("%d ", grid[r][c]);
}
```

### 5.3 Dynamic Multidimensional Arrays

- For large or variable-sized arrays, use pointers to pointers (see next section).

---

## 6. Strings in C: Representation and Manipulation

### 6.1 What is a String in C?

- An array of `char` terminated with a `\0`
- No built-in string type; use arrays and pointers

```c
char name[16] = "Workstation";
printf("%s\n", name); // Print as string
```

### 6.2 Common String Functions

- `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strncpy`, `strcmp`, `strcat`
- Always check buffer sizes to avoid overflows!

**Example:**
```c
#include <string.h>
char patch[64];
strcpy(patch, "Bass 1");
strcat(patch, " - Fat");
printf("%s\n", patch); // "Bass 1 - Fat"
```

### 6.3 Dynamic Strings

- Allocate with `malloc` if size is not known at compile time
- Always `free` when done

---

## 7. Dynamic Memory Allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`)

### 7.1 Why Use Dynamic Allocation?

- For buffers, voices, or resources whose size isn’t known until runtime
- For efficient use of limited RAM

### 7.2 `malloc` and `free`

```c
float *audio_buffer = (float *)malloc(1024 * sizeof(float));
if (!audio_buffer) { /* handle error */ }
audio_buffer[0] = 0.1f;
free(audio_buffer);
```

### 7.3 `calloc` and `realloc`

- `calloc`: Like malloc, but zeroes memory
- `realloc`: Change size of an allocation

**Example:**
```c
int *arr = (int*)calloc(64, sizeof(int)); // 64 zeros
arr = (int*)realloc(arr, 128 * sizeof(int)); // Grow buffer
free(arr);
```

### 7.4 Common Pitfalls

- Always check that allocation succeeded (pointer is not NULL)
- Free every allocation exactly once (no leaks, no double-free)
- Never use memory after freeing it (“use-after-free” bug)

---

## 8. Memory Safety: Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Buffer overruns:** Writing past the end of an array
- **Dangling pointers:** Using a pointer after freeing its memory
- **Memory leaks:** Allocated memory not freed
- **Uninitialized memory:** Using data before setting it

**Best Practices:**
- Initialize pointers to NULL
- Use tools like `valgrind` to check for leaks and invalid memory use
- Use size-safe string functions (`strncpy`, `snprintf`)

---

## 9. Structs: Building Custom Data Types

### 9.1 Why Structs?

- Group related data: e.g., Envelope, Oscillator, Voice

### 9.2 Declaring and Using Structs

```c
typedef struct {
    float attack;
    float decay;
    float sustain;
    float release;
} Envelope;

Envelope env = {0.01f, 0.2f, 0.8f, 0.5f};
printf("Attack: %f\n", env.attack);
```

### 9.3 Pointers to Structs

```c
Envelope *env_ptr = &env;
printf("Sustain: %f\n", env_ptr->sustain);
```

### 9.4 Structs with Arrays and Pointers

```c
typedef struct {
    char name[32];
    float *buffer;
    int length;
} Sample;
```

---

## 10. Passing by Value vs. Passing by Reference

- By default, C passes arguments **by value**: a copy is made.
- To change the caller’s variable, **pass a pointer** (by reference).

**Example:**
```c
void set_attack(Envelope *env, float value) {
    env->attack = value;
}
```

---

## 11. Practice Section 2: Pointers, Arrays, and Memory in Action

### 11.1 Dynamic Voice Pool

Write code to allocate an array of `Voice` structs at runtime, initialize, and free it.

```c
typedef struct {
    float freq;
    int active;
} Voice;

int main() {
    int num_voices = 16;
    Voice *voices = (Voice*)calloc(num_voices, sizeof(Voice));
    for(int i = 0; i < num_voices; ++i) {
        voices[i].freq = 440.0f * i;
        voices[i].active = 0;
    }
    // Use voices...
    free(voices);
    return 0;
}
```

### 11.2 String Handling

Write a function that takes a pointer to a patch name and copies it to a buffer safely.

```c
void set_patch_name(char *dest, size_t dest_size, const char *src) {
    strncpy(dest, src, dest_size-1);
    dest[dest_size-1] = '\0'; // Always null terminate
}
```

## 12. Exercises

1. **Pointer Practice**
   - Declare an int, a pointer to int, and print the address and value using both.
   - Modify the value via the pointer and print again.

2. **Dynamic Array**
   - Write code to allocate an array of floats for an audio buffer, set all values to zero, then free the memory.

3. **Structs and References**
   - Create a struct for a filter with type, cutoff, and resonance.
   - Write a function to change its cutoff via a pointer.

4. **Safe String Copy**
   - Write a function that safely copies user-provided patch names (max 32 chars) into a struct.

5. **Memory Leak Detection**
   - Install and use `valgrind` to check for leaks in your program.

6. **Buffer Overrun Test**
   - Deliberately write past the end of a small array and observe what happens. (Warning: May crash! Learn how to detect it.)
