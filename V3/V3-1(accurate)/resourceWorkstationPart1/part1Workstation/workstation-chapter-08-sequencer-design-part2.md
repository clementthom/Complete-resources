## 1. Introduction: Beyond Basic Sequencing

After mastering basic step and real-time sequencing, musicians and engineers demand more:
- Microtiming for groove and feel
- Polymeter and polyrhythm for creative patterns
- Automation for dynamic, evolving sequences
- Song mode for arranging patterns into full pieces
- Fast, powerful editing and workflow
- Tight sync and deep integration with MIDI, DAWs, and analog gear

**Why does this matter?**
- The groove and flow of a song depend on subtle microtiming and automation.
- Modern music uses advanced rhythms and polymeters.
- Seamless integration with other gear (MIDI/CV) and DAWs is non-negotiable for pros.
- The UI and song workflow must empower both beginners and power users.

## 2. Microtiming and Groove Control

### 2.1 What is Microtiming?

- **Microtiming:** Fine-grained adjustment of the timing of each step or note, beyond simple quantization.
- Used for "groove," swing, shuffle, and subtle humanization.
- Allows steps to be pushed or pulled ahead/behind the grid for feel.

### 2.2 Swing, Shuffle, and Humanization

- **Swing:** Offsets every other step (or more complex patterns) to create groove.
- **Shuffle:** Similar to swing, but may apply to triplets or subdivisions.
- **Humanization:** Adds random or programmed variability to step timing, velocity, gate, etc.

**Swing Example:**  
In a 16-step sequence at 50% swing, every even step is delayed by a percentage of the step duration.

### 2.3 Microtiming Data Structures and UI

- **Per-Step Offset:** Each step stores a signed offset (ticks or ms) from the grid position.
    - `int8_t micro_offset; // -127 to +127 ticks`
- **Groove Templates:** Predefined microtiming maps (e.g., MPC, TR-909, custom templates)
- **UI:** Allow drag, dial, or numeric entry for per-step microtiming. Display nudge visually.

### 2.4 Implementation and Playback Algorithms

- At playback, each step's time = grid time + microtiming offset.
- For high PPQN, use sub-tick scheduling for precision.
- If external clock, apply offset relative to incoming tick.

### 2.5 Groove Templates and Presets

- Factory templates emulate classic hardware grooves (MPC, LinnDrum, 808 swing).
- User can design/save custom grooves.
- Groove templates can alter microtiming, velocity, accent, or all three.

### 2.6 Practice: Building a Microtiming Engine

- Implement per-step microtiming in your step sequencer.
- Add a selection of groove templates and allow user assignment.
- Create a UI for viewing and editing microtiming offsets.

## 3. Polymeter and Polyrhythm

### 3.1 Definitions and Musical Examples

- **Polymeter:** Different tracks/patterns have different step lengths or bar lengths but the same underlying beat.
    - Example: Track 1 = 16 steps, Track 2 = 12 steps, both at 1/16 note.
- **Polyrhythm:** Different tracks play different subdivisions of the beat within the same time window.
    - Example: 3 against 4; one track plays triplets, another plays straight quarter notes.

### 3.2 Track Length, Step Division, and Pattern Looping

- Each track has independent pattern length (steps per loop).
- Step size can differ per track (e.g., 1/16, 1/8, 1/12).
- Patterns can loop out of phase, creating evolving rhythms.

### 3.3 Polymetric vs. Polyrhythmic Sequencing

- Polymeter: Track lengths differ, but pulses align (e.g., 5 steps vs. 7 steps).
- Polyrhythm: Tracks subdivide bar differently, but start/end together (e.g., 3 notes vs. 4 notes per bar).

### 3.4 Creating Complex Patterns and Cycles

- Allow user to set arbitrary pattern length per track (not limited to 16/32).
- Visualization: Show cycle length, highlight when tracks realign.
- Cross-pattern modulation: modulate one track from another's step.

### 3.5 Visualization and User Interface

- Show each track as a ring or linear array, with independent playheads.
- Indicate cycle resets and when all tracks align.
- Support step muting, soloing, and conditional triggers.

### 3.6 Practice: Implementing Polymeter in Software

- Write a sequencer engine supporting independent track lengths.
- Display visual feedback for cycle alignment in UI.
- Allow copy/paste of patterns between tracks with differing lengths.

## 4. Automation and Advanced Parameter Sequencing

### 4.1 CC, NRPN, Sysex, and Internal Automation

- **CC (Control Change):** Standard MIDI controller (mod wheel, cutoff, etc.)
- **NRPN (Non-Registered Parameter Number):** Extended MIDI control for synth-specific parameters.
- **Sysex:** Manufacturer-specific messages for deep control.
- **Internal Automation:** Direct control of engine parameters outside MIDI.

### 4.2 Automation Lanes, Curves, Step Modulation

- **Automation Lane:** Timeline for a parameter, can be step-based or continuous.
- **Curves:** Linear, exponential, custom drawn shapes for smooth transitions.
- **Per-Step Modulation:** Set value per step (e.g., step filter cutoff).

### 4.3 Recording, Editing, and Smoothing Automation

- Record automation in real-time (knob/fader moves).
- Edit points/curves in UI; quantize, smooth, or randomize values.
- Smoothing prevents abrupt jumps and zipper noise.

### 4.4 Per-Step Modulation vs. Continuous Lanes

- Per-step: Fixed value applies only on this step (classic x0x sequencers).
- Continuous: Parameter changes over time, can affect held notes.

### 4.5 Real-Time Automation Recording and Playback

- Support overdubbing and punch-in recording.
- Allow parameter locking (prevent accidental overwrite).
- Automation playback is tightly synced to timeline and external clocks.

### 4.6 Practice: Advanced Automation Editor

- Implement UI for drawing/editing automation curves.
- Allow assignment of automation lanes to any parameter.
- Enable copy/paste and undo/redo for automation edits.

## 5. Song Mode, Pattern Chaining, and Arrangement

### 5.1 Pattern Chaining and Song Arrangement

- **Pattern Chain:** Sequence of patterns (A, B, C...) with repeats and jumps.
- **Song Mode:** Arrange patterns into complete songs, with sections (intro, verse, chorus, etc.).
- **Arranger Track:** Higher-level track to define song structure.

### 5.2 Repeat, Jump, Conditional Triggers

- Set repeat count for each pattern (e.g., play pattern A x4).
- Jumps: manual or automatic to next/previous pattern (song sections).
- Conditional Triggers: e.g., fill every 4th loop, randomize next section.

### 5.3 Sections, Scenes, and Arranger Tracks

- Divide songs into sections: Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Outro.
- Scene recall: Instantly load a saved combination of patterns for all tracks.
- Arranger track: Visual timeline of section arrangement.

### 5.4 Song Position Pointer, Markers, and Looping

- SPP: MIDI message to jump to a specific bar/beat.
- Markers: Set/cue points for jumping during performance or editing.
- Looping: Define loop regions in song for practice or performance.

### 5.5 Practice: Building a Song Mode Engine

- Implement pattern chaining and song arrangement in code.
- Allow live manipulation of arrangement during playback.
- Save and recall songs with all pattern/section assignments.
