## 1. Capstone Architecture Review: Bringing It All Together

Now that you’ve studied modular design, HW/SW partitioning, interface documentation, error handling, and future-proofing, let’s walk through a realistic capstone example.

**Goals:**
- See how all modules interconnect and interact
- Learn what can go wrong in integration
- Understand documentation and test requirements for a "real" project

+-------------+-------------+      +---+---+---+---+---+

+---------------------------+
```

#### Hardware Modules

- **UI Board:** Encoders, touch panel, OLED display, RGB LEDs
- **Main CPU/DSP Board:** Raspberry Pi or STM32, RAM, storage, digital audio I/O
- **Analog Out Board:** VCF, VCA, analog mixer, headphone out
- **Power Supply:** +5V, ±12V, 3.3V rails
- **I/O Expander Board:** MIDI, USB, CV/Gate, SD, Ethernet

#### Software Modules

- **HAL:** Abstracts all hardware access
- **Audio Engine:** Synthesis, sampling, mixing, FX
- **Sequencer:** Event scheduling, pattern/step/real-time modes
- **UI:** Menu, display, encoder/touch handling
- **Storage:** File I/O, patch management, firmware update
- **Communication:** MIDI, USB, network protocols

### 2.2 Interfaces, Protocols, and Data Flows

- **UI <-> CPU:** SPI for display, I2C for encoders/buttons, GPIO for interrupts
- **CPU <-> Analog Out:** I2S for audio, SPI/I2C for control (VCF cutoff, VCA gain)
- **CPU <-> Storage:** SD/eMMC via SPI/SDIO, FAT32 file system
- **CPU <-> MIDI/USB:** UART for MIDI DIN, USB host/device for USB-MIDI, networking

### 2.3 Example: Voice Signal Flow (Key Press to Output)

1. User presses a key (UI Board → Main CPU via I2C interrupt)
2. CPU triggers note-on event in sequencer/audio engine
3. Audio engine allocates a voice, computes oscillator/envelope parameters
4. Synthesizes N samples (buffer) in real-time audio callback
5. Audio buffer sent to DAC via I2S (DMA transfer)
6. DAC output goes to Analog Out Board (filtered, mixed, amplified)
7. Analog output sent to main out/headphones

### 2.4 Example: Patch Loading and Editing

1. User selects "Load Patch" in UI (event sent over SPI/I2C)
2. CPU loads patch data from SD card (file system module)
3. Patch parameters sent to audio engine
4. UI updates display to show new patch parameters
5. User tweaks filter cutoff; UI sends update, audio engine applies change live

### 2.5 Example: Firmware Update and Error Recovery

1. User inserts SD card with new firmware file
2. CPU verifies firmware integrity (CRC/checksum)
3. If valid, system enters bootloader mode and flashes update
4. Any errors (power loss, bad CRC) are logged and reported on next boot
5. If update fails, system rolls back to previous firmware, logs error

## 3. Integrating Digital and Analog Domains

### 3.1 Digital Audio to Analog Output

- Digital audio (PCM samples) sent from CPU to DAC via I2S or SPI
- DAC output is low-pass filtered (often with a simple RC or active circuit)
- VCA for volume control, then analog mixing
- Final stage: headphone driver or line output buffer

### 3.2 Clocking, Jitter, and Grounding

- Use a master clock for all digital audio (CPU, DAC, ADC)
- Keep clock lines short, use proper impedance
- Isolate analog and digital grounds, connect at a single point (star grounding)
- Use ground planes and shielding to reduce noise

### 3.3 Digital Control of Analog Circuits

- Digital control signals (SPI/I2C) set VCF cutoff, VCA gain via DACs or digital potentiometers
- Use opto-isolators or level shifters if voltage domains differ
- Debounce all mechanical switches in hardware or firmware

### 3.4 Noise, Crosstalk, and Shielding

- Keep analog and digital traces separate on PCB
- Shield analog sections from digital EMI
- Route sensitive analog signals away from clocks, high-speed digital traces

### 3.5 Practical PCB Layout Guidelines

- Use short, thick traces for power and ground
- Decouple every IC with ceramic caps (0.1uF + 10uF)
- Minimize via count for analog signals
- Pay attention to return paths for high-current signals

## 4. System-Level Debugging and Bring-Up

### 4.1 Step-by-Step Bring-Up Checklist

1. Power supply validation (check all rails, no load and under load)
2. Confirm CPU boots (basic indicator LED or serial output)
3. Test hardware interfaces one at a time (UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO)
4. Bring up basic UI (display test, button/encoder reads)
5. Audio path: verify DAC/ADC with known test signals

### 4.2 Board-By-Board Testing

- Test each board standalone first (test fixture or breakout)
- Use loopback or dummy loads for analog boards
- Use logic analyzer for digital signals

### 4.3 Interface Test Points and Probes

- Add labeled test points on every board (I2C, SPI, audio, power)
- Use scope, logic analyzer, or multimeter to verify signals

### 4.4 Firmware/Bootloader Bring-Up

- Start with minimal code (blink LED, serial hello)
- Incrementally add and test hardware drivers
- Enable watchdog early to catch lockups

### 4.5 Early Audio and UI Testing

- Generate test tone (sine, square) in code, confirm at output
- Test UI responsiveness (input lag, display update speed)
- Stress test (hold multiple keys, rapid patch changes)

## 5. System Integration and Validation

### 5.1 Integration Phases

- **Unit Test:** Each module/board in isolation
- **Module Test:** HW/SW together (e.g., UI board with main CPU)
- **System Test:** All modules together, real-world use cases

### 5.2 Automated Test Scripts

- Write scripts to send/receive known data over each interface
- Log results for regression testing

### 5.3 End-to-End Use Case Validation

- Run through all key user stories (play, record, edit, save, load, update)
- Record test results, bugs, and regression issues

### 5.4 Regression Testing and Field Upgrades

- Save test cases for every bug fixed
- Automate tests after every firmware update
- Provide user-facing diagnostics for field troubleshooting

### 7.3 Interface Validation

- Design a test plan for all major interfaces: SPI, I2C, I2S, UART, analog I/O
- Write example test transactions and expected outcomes

### 7.4 Maintenance and Upgrade Scenario

- Simulate a failed module (e.g., analog board). Plan and document the swap procedure, re-test, and user notification

### 7.5 Documentation Kit

- Assemble a mini doc set: annotated schematic, protocol doc, test plan, and user quick-start
