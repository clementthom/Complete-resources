## 1. Preparing for Assembly

- Gather tools: screwdrivers, pliers, wire strippers, soldering iron
- Print layout and double-check fit

---

## 2. Fitting Boards and Controls

- Mount PCBs on standoffs or spacers
- Use panel-mount versions for jacks and encoders
- Ensure display/touch lines up with cutouts

---

## 3. Internal Wiring

- Use color-coded wires for signal, power, ground
- Keep analog and digital wires separated where possible
- Twist pairs to reduce noise pickup

---

## 4. Shielding

- Use foil or mesh for shielding analog sections
- Connect shields to ground at one point only

---

## 5. Strain Relief

- Use zip ties, cable glands, or adhesive clips
- Prevent wires from pulling off PCB or jacks

---

## 6. Mounting Jacks and Controls

- Secure all connectors tightly (no spinning jacks!)
- Test fit knobs and buttons before wiring

---

## 7. Assembly Workflow

- Mount power, then mainboard, then display, then controls
- Test at each step (power up, check voltages, display, etc.)

---

## 8. Testing Subsystems

- Power up with only power supply and check voltages
- Add display and check
- Add engine board and test MIDI/audio

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

- If something doesn’t work, disconnect and test piece by piece
- Use multimeter to check continuity and shorts

---

## 10. Exercises

- Build and test your full enclosure
- Add internal cable labels for future repairs
- Take photos and log each assembly stage
