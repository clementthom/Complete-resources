## 1. What Makes a Synth GUI Musical?

- Fast parameter access (no deep menu diving)
- Immediate feedback (visual and audio)
- Clear, readable, consistent interface
- Inspiration: the “page R” sequencer, the “matrix” of the PPG, OB-X panels

---

## 2. UI Case Studies

- **Fairlight CMI:** Icon grid, “Page” system, monochrome CRT, stylus/touch
- **Synclavier:** Text menus, numeric data, dedicated buttons
- **PPG Wave:** Parameter grid, matrix navigation, minimal modes
- **DX7:** Membrane buttons, 2-line LCD, heavy paging

---

## 3. Information Architecture

- List your synth’s features (engine, sequencer, patch edit, MIDI, etc.)
- Group into logical screens
- Map navigation: main menu → submenus → action screens

---

## 4. Wireframing: Sketches

- Use pen/paper, Figma, or draw.io
- Sketch main screens: home, patch, sequencer, settings

---

## 5. Menu, Grid, and Modal Interfaces

- **Menu:** Classic, vertical list (DX7)
- **Grid:** “Matrix” (PPG), direct access
- **Modal:** One mode active at a time (edit, play, etc.)

---

## 6. Navigation

- Touch: tap, drag, swipe; clear hit areas
- Encoder: up/down, enter/back
- Hardware: assignable buttons

---

## 7. Visual Feedback

- Highlight selected/active items
- Use contrast, inversion, or simple animation
- Disable unavailable controls

---

## 8. Sizing Elements

- Minimum 10x10mm for touch targets
- Text: at least 8-10px on 128x64 screens

---

## 9. Accessibility

- High contrast
- Avoid flashing/rapid changes
- Logical, consistent navigation

---

## 10. Hands-On: Paper Prototype

- Sketch your main UI screens
- Get feedback from friends/musicians

---

## 11. Exercises

- Wireframe your sequencer UI
- Make a list of “must-reach-in-1-tap” features
- Mock up a patch edit screen and navigation
