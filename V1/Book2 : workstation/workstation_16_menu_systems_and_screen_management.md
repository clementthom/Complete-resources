## 1. Menu System Architecture

- Hierarchical (main menu → submenus)
- Flat (matrix/grid)
- Stack-based (push/pop screens)

---

## 2. Menu Data Structures

```c
typedef struct MenuItem {
  const char *label;
  void (*callback)(void);
  struct MenuItem *submenu;
} MenuItem;
```

- Arrays of MenuItem for each screen

---

## 3. Screen Management

- Use enum or pointer to track current screen
- Stack or tree for multi-level navigation

---

## 4. Handling User Input

- Touch: detect tap, swipe, hold; map to menu item
- Encoder: up/down selects, press confirms
- Button: assign actions (back, home, select)

---

## 5. Drawing Menus

- Highlight selected item
- Scroll if too many items for screen
- Animate transitions if desired

---

## 6. Modal Dialogs and Popups

- Confirmations, warnings, help overlays
- Block background input when active

---

## 7. Patch Browser and Sequencer Navigation

- Scrollable lists with banks/folders
- Grid for steps/tracks in sequencer

---

## 8. Memory and Performance

- Static allocation for simple menus
- Avoid malloc/free in tight loops

---

## 9. Hands-On

- Code a main menu with submenus for Play, Edit, Seq, Settings
- Switch screens on event

---

## 10. Exercises

- Add a popup confirmation (“Delete patch?”)
- Implement back navigation (hardware button or gesture)
- Highlight the active screen/menu in your code
