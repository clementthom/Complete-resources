## 1. Why Design Matters

- Usable, readable, and attractive instruments get used more
- Poor ergonomics = bad user experience

---

## 2. Planning Layout

- List all controls, jacks, display(s)
- Sketch top and side views

---

## 3. Materials

- Laser-cut acrylic, 3D printed ABS/PLA, sheet metal, wood
- Choose for strength, look, and ease of prototyping

---

## 4. Panel Markings

- Silkscreen, laser, CNC, stickers
- Label all controls, jacks, and screen areas

---

## 5. Ergonomics

- Button/knob spacing: 1.5-2cm minimum
- Display: angle for visibility
- Hand rests

---

## 6. Prototyping

- Cardboard/foam for layout tests
- FreeCAD or TinkerCAD for 3D design

---

## 7. Mounting

- Standoffs, screws, glue
- Allow access for rework and upgrades

---

## 8. Assembly Techniques

- Self-tapping screws, heat-set inserts
- Captive nuts for repeated assembly/disassembly

---

## 9. Hands-On

- Build a full-scale cardboard mockup
- Test all control placements

---

## 10. Exercises

- Design your panel in a CAD tool
- Get feedback from other musicians/builders
