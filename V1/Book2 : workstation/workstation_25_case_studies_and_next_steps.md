## 1. Fairlight CMI

- 1979, first digital workstation
- CRT, stylus, Page R sequencer, sample-based synthesis

---

## 2. Synclavier

- Modular, text-based UI, powerful digital synthesis
- Dedicated hardware controls, early disk storage

---

## 3. PPG Wave and Realiser

- Grid/matrix UI, touch and pen, wavetable synthesis
- Emphasis on real-time control and visual feedback

---

## 4. Modern Open Source

- Zynthian, Norns, Organelle, Mutable Instruments, Axoloti

---

## 5. Lessons from the Pros

- Fast, musical UI beats “feature bloat”
- Hands-on control + visual feedback = magic

---

## 6. Next Steps

- Try granular, physical modeling, or spectral synthesis
- Explore FPGAs or custom ASICs

---

## 7. Further Learning

- “The Art of Electronics” (Horowitz & Hill)
- “Designing Sound” (Andy Farnell)
- YouTube: Hainbach, Look Mum No Computer

---

## 8. Building a Career or Hobby

- Document and share your journey
- Connect with other makers and musicians

---

## 9. Staying Curious

- Try new UI ideas, new sound engines, new hardware

---

## 10. Final Challenges

- Build a sequencer with visual step editing
- Add a sampler/recorder to your workstation
- Teach someone else what you’ve learned!
