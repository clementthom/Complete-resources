## 1. Welcome and What You’ll Build

Welcome to your journey in building a **monochrome touch workstation synthesizer**, inspired by classics like the Synclavier, Fairlight, PPG, DX1, and OB-X!  
This series will take you, step by step, from zero knowledge to building a professional-grade, touch-controlled workstation instrument.

---

## 2. Course Philosophy: Learning by Doing

- Every topic is taught through hands-on exercises.
- You’ll build working code and breadboard circuits as you learn.
- Each document builds on previous skills, with practical assignments.

---

## 3. What is a Workstation Synth/Keyboard?

A workstation is:
- **A digital musical instrument** with sequencing, editing, and performance built in.
- **A user interface (UI)**: touchscreen, buttons, menus, and real-time controls.
- **A sound engine**: sample playback, synthesis, effects, and MIDI.

---

## 4. Inspirational Instruments and Interfaces

- **Synclavier:** Text-based, grid-like UI, advanced digital synthesis.
- **Fairlight Series III:** Page R sequencer, CRT, pen/touch input.
- **Emulator III:** Menu LCD, real-time sample editing.
- **PPG Wave/Realiser:** Matrix menus, digital/analog hybrid.
- **DX1, OB-X:** Real/virtual controls, clear displays.

## 5. Your Project: Features and Ambitions

By the end, you’ll have:
- A touch-driven synth workstation with a monochrome GUI
- Sequencer and song mode
- Polyphonic, multi-timbral sound engine
- MIDI input/output
- Real hardware: display, touchscreen, Pi, encoders/buttons, analog output

## 6. How to Use This Resource

- Read sequentially; each part builds on the last.
- Do every exercise and keep a project log.
- Adapt ideas—customize your UI, sounds, and features.

---

## 7. Mindset and Best Practices

- Debugging and mistakes are part of learning.
- Document your work: notes, photos, commit code.
- Ask for help in forums and communities.

---

## 8. Safety, Community, and Open Source

- Low-voltage circuits are safe, but always double-check power.
- The synth DIY community is welcoming.
- Please share your journey and help others!
