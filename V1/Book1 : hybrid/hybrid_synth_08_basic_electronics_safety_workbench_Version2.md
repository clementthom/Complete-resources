## 1. Why Learn Electronics?

You need to build, test, and debug analog/physical circuits to create a hybrid synth.  
Electronics skills are essential for wiring DACs, building filters, and troubleshooting.

---

## 2. Essential Tools and Workspace Setup

- **Breadboard, jumper wires**
- **Multimeter** (for voltage, current, resistance)
- **Oscilloscope** (even a USB one)
- **Soldering iron, solder**
- **Wire cutters/strippers**
- **Power supply (bench or wall wart)**

---

## 3. Understanding Electricity and Safety

- **Voltage (V), Current (A), Resistance (Ω)**
- **Ohm’s Law:** V = I * R
- Always turn off power before changing wiring.
- Use low voltages for experiments (<12V).

---

## 4. Identifying Components

- **Resistors:** Color bands (value)
- **Capacitors:** µF or nF, polarity for electrolytic
- **ICs:** Pin 1 marker; datasheets are your friend
- **Op-amps:** Used for filters, buffers, and mixing

---

## 5. Breadboarding and Prototyping

- Push components into breadboard, use jumper wires
- Avoid shorts, double-check power rails

---

## 6. Soldering Basics

- Use a clean, tinned tip
- Heat both pad and lead, apply solder
- Don’t breathe fumes, work in ventilated area

---

## 7. Using a Multimeter and Oscilloscope

- Multimeter: Check power, continuity, component values
- Oscilloscope: Visualize waveforms, measure frequency, check for noise

---

## 8. Static Electricity and ESD Safety

- Touch grounded object before handling ICs
- Use anti-static wrist strap if possible

---

## 9. Your First Circuit: Blinking an LED

- Connect a resistor (220Ω) and LED in series from +5V to ground, with a switch.

---

## 10. Exercises

- Identify and measure resistors and capacitors in your kit.
- Build and test the LED circuit.
- Use your multimeter to check voltages on your breadboard.
